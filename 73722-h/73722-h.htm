<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br>

<small>A GARDEN GROWS</small></h2>
</div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first2"><p class="drop-cap">“IL y a dans ce village</p></div>
<div class="indent2">Une enfant a l’œil noir.</div>
<div class="verse">C’est Jeanne au frais visage;</div>
<div class="verse">Elle chant matin et soir.</div>
<div class="verse">Elle est rieuse et belle,</div>
<div class="verse">Et dans nos environs</div>
<div class="verse">Tout le monde l’appelle</div>
<div class="verse">La fillette au chansons.</div>
<div class="indent">Tra la la—”</div>
</div></div>

<p>sang Lucie as she sat on a stone bench under a
sheltering cherry tree. The “tra la la” suddenly
ceased at a stir of the branches on the
other side. Lucie glanced up with a twinkle
in her eyes and changed the song to “Way down
upon the Swanee river.”</p>

<p>“Lucie, Lucie, what are those funny words
you sing?” called some one from over the wall.</p>

<p>“<i>Ma foi</i>, what ignorance!” returned Lucie
with an uplift of her eyebrows. “As if one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
could not tell. Did you never hear ‘the Old
Folks at Home’?”</p>

<p>“What is this ‘Ole folk zat ome?’ I do not
know,” returned the voice.</p>

<p>Lucie laughed. “Come over, come over,
Annette, and I will teach it to you. It will be
droll to hear you sing it.”</p>

<p>Annette climbed nimbly to the top of the
stone wall, and presently dropped to her feet,
avoiding bushes and vines in order to make her
way to where Lucie was sitting. “It is droll
enough to hear you sing it,” she remarked. “It
is in English of course.”</p>

<p>“American English; a song my mother often
sings and which every one knows over there
in the United States.”</p>

<p>“And you will teach it to me, this song?
I shall like to sing it for grandfather. How he
will be amused when he hears it.”</p>

<p>“Then repeat after me.”</p>

<p>This Annette essayed to do, but her efforts
brought such peals of laughter from Lucie that
she stopped with a pout. “How you are a silly
one,” exclaimed she. “Me, I am all French.
Can I then be expected to know English? If
you will perhaps write the words for me I may
then be able to say them, but when you speak so
fast and run the words together at such a rate
I cannot follow you.” She produced a piece of
paper and a stub of pencil. Lucie carefully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
wrote out the first line, handed the paper back
to Annette and waited with a gleeful smile.</p>

<p>“Vay don oopon ze Svanay reebair,” began
Annette reading slowly. Then down fluttered
the paper. “I cannot,” she cried. “This English
is a monster! a Turkey! a pig! a thing
impossible. I do not see how you can understand
or speak it.”</p>

<p>“I speak it as well as I do French,” returned
Lucie proudly. “Mamma wishes that I shall,
for one day, behold! we go to her home to that
same United States, then before my relations
I shall not feel ashamed. I should consider
myself a silly one if I could not understand them
nor they me.”</p>

<p>“For me then there will arise no occasion for
feeling shame, and therefore there is no need to
learn this tongue, for I have no relatives in
that country,” returned Annette complacently.
“Would you not, Lucie, prefer to be all French.
Is it not a sorrow to you that you are part English?”</p>

<p>“No, no,” Lucie shook her head. “I am not
English, and I am very proud of my American
blood and that I have American aunts and
uncles. As for my mother, she tells me that she
became French when she married a Frenchman,
so this is now her country as well as my father’s
and mine. I adore my France where I was born
and where I hope I may die when my hour comes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
It is the land of my father, my mother, my dear
old grandfather. No, you cannot say I am
English, Annette.”</p>

<p>This outbreak entirely satisfied Annette, who
quite willingly changed the subject when her
friend proposed that they should go further into
the garden to see a certain rose now blooming
gloriously. “Is it not magnificent?” Lucie
asked as they stopped before the bush.</p>

<p>Annette viewed it with admiration. “It is
truly,” she acknowledged, “more beautiful
than my grandfather’s. Now he will be envious,
that poor grandfather, for ours has not
half the number of blooms.”</p>

<p>“They are very droll, those two old ones,
your grandfather and mine,” remarked Lucie.
“To hear them argue over a bed of cabbages
one would think them the most important
things in the world. They are never so happy
as when they are discussing the merits of their
gardens. For my part I cannot see that one
is better than the other. They grow; there is
enough and more than enough for our use, so
what does it matter? Here comes Paulette
now to gather vegetables. Shall we help her to
pick the peas, Annette?”</p>

<p>“And shell them afterward?”</p>

<p>“Why yes, if you will.”</p>

<p>Paulette, rugged of feature, brown of skin,
sharp-eyed and capable, came forward with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
basket on her arm. She wore a stuff skirt,
a huge apron, a stout sacque and a little cap.
Her face was rather grave and stern until she
smiled, then her expression showed a kindly
humor.</p>

<p>“May we help you gather the peas, Paulette?”
asked Lucie, balancing herself on one foot.</p>

<p>Paulette scanned the vines. “Yes, if you will
be careful to pick only the well-filled pods. One
may not take those not fully matured. Guard
well against that.”</p>

<p>“We know and we will be careful,” returned
Lucie and forthwith the three set to work, the
girls using their aprons to hold the gathered
pods, Paulette giving them once in a while a
sharp eye to see that they performed their task
properly.</p>

<p>At last when peas, carrots, onions, lettuce had
been gathered Paulette carried them into the
house and the little girls sat down again on the
stone bench to shell the peas. Paulette meantime
bustled in and out to bring water, to wash
the lettuce and swing it around and around in a
wire basket that it might be freed from all moisture,
to scrape the little potatoes, to pick over the
herbs for the ragout. The warm air was scented
with odors from the garden, the rose-bushes, the
clambering vines and mellowing fruit. The
two girls chattered away like magpies about
pleasant, homely things: their lessons, their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
pets, the growing garden, the good curé, the
kind nuns. Outside the white wall the noises
from the long street seemed only sociable sounds.
Carts rattled along, children called to one another,
men tramped home from the factories to
their midday meal, stopping their whistling
or singing to greet some friend. All this made
a pleasant accompaniment to the drone of bees,
and the drowsy crooning of hens in the chicken
yard. There were homely, suggestive sounds,
too, from the kitchens.</p>

<p>The two little girls, Lucie Du Bois and Annette
Le Brun, were great friends, as might be surmised
since they were next door neighbors.
Lucie, her father and mother, her grandfather,
Paulette, their maid and her son Jean, occupied
a comfortable, square house whose red-tiled roof
could be seen when winter stripped the leaves
from the trees, but which in summer was almost
hidden by green. A white stucco wall separated
the garden from that of the Le Bruns,
but the wall was not an impassable barrier, for
the two girls, by means of a ladder, or, when
the ladder was lacking, by means of overhanging
branches, were able to climb back and
forth.</p>

<p>Dark-haired, brown-eyed Annette lived with
her grandparents. She was a bright, ardent
little soul, adoring her best friend, Lucie, who
excelled her in imagination and sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
surprised her by her vivid way of telling things.
Lucie, too, had dark eyes like her father’s, but
her hair was a soft golden brown like her
mother’s. She was about fourteen, Annette a
year older. While the latter had legends of the
saints at her tongue’s end, Lucie had far wider
information concerning more modern tales. She
never tired of hearing from her mother stories
of the Indians and of her pioneer forefathers.
These stories she would retell to Annette, who
listened wide-eyed. Moreover there was a
small collection of her mother’s girlhood books
which Lucie was permitted to have and from
which she gained a knowledge not only of her
mother’s native tongue, but of things American.
Therefore to Annette she was a very superior
person whose companionship she greatly enjoyed,
and preferred to that of any other girl
she knew.</p>

<p>The big factory with the tall chimney over to
the west belonged to the Du Boises; that on
the other side of the town to the Le Bruns.
Grandfather Du Bois had retired from active
business, but still made a daily visit to the rooms
where clattering machines whizzed and whirled
all day long. He liked to talk over affairs with
his son who had taken his place in the business.
Monsieur Le Brun still remained head of his
firm, having no son to succeed him, though he
often spoke of the day when Annette should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
marry and a <i>petit fils</i> should relieve him of his
cares.</p>

<p>The task of shelling the peas was far from
being a disagreeable one, for while their fingers
split the fresh pods and raked the pale green
globes from them, the two girls chattered incessantly
and at last began the subject which
they often discussed but never failed to enjoy.
This time it was Annette who began by asking:
“Have you really made up your mind which
saint you prefer?”</p>

<p>“For me it is Saint Elizabeth of Hungary or
Saint Ursula,” replied Lucie. “I adore that
story of the loaves of bread turned into roses,
and I also like Saint Ursula for she was of
Brittany. It must have been wonderful to see
her leading her eleven thousand virgins.”</p>

<p>“You would like to do that sort of thing,
wouldn’t you, my Lucie? Have you no saint
of your own country that you would like above
all others?”</p>

<p>“My own country? France is my country.”</p>

<p>“I mean that country of the United States
that you are always talking about.”</p>

<p>“How you are foolish,” returned Lucie crossly.
“Why do you try to separate me from the land of
my birth? I think you are very unkind. I
don’t believe you want to acknowledge me as a
compatriot.”</p>

<p>Annette looked a trifle abashed. She had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
really meant only to tease. “Well,” she began
to hunt around for an excuse, “you are continually
telling me of its wonders, and you speak of
the characters in those story books as if you were
intimately acquainted with them, that Jo and
her sisters in that ‘Leetle Veemen’ you so like.”</p>

<p>“Of course I am intimately acquainted with
them, for I have read that book many times.
One may have friends anywhere, but that does
not mean one must adopt their countries.”</p>

<p>This argument proved Lucie’s case and Annette
changed the subject back again to the
favorite saints. “If you will have a sweet saint
of France there is Saint Genevieve,” she remarked.
“It was she whose prayers delivered
Paris from Attila the Hun, you remember.”</p>

<p>“Yes, she is very nice,” Lucie acknowledged
somewhat flippantly, not being in a mood to
accept any suggestion, “but you see every one
knows about her. I should like to have as my
favorite some one more uncommon. I think I
shall ask Sister Marie Ottilia to find me a saint
that I can feel very near to because she has not
too many followers.” She set the subject aside
with an air of finality, and Annette felt that this
time she had really gone too far in her desire to
tease.</p>

<p>The two were silent till at last Lucie said:
“There, Annette, these are the last. I will
take them in. The pods Paulette can give to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
the animals. See, already my pigeons are coming
for a share of the peas. I can give them only
a few, for Paulette will scold if she thinks I am
wasting them. She has a sharp eye for food,
that Paulette. Wait for me, Annette, I will
bring a book.”</p>

<p>Emboldened by this overture of peace Annette
ventured to say: “Not ‘Leetle Veemen.’ I cannot
understand that.”</p>

<p>Lucie paused with the brown basin of peas in
her hand and threw a laughing glance over her
shoulder. “Perhaps you would better like
something of Dickens,” she said.</p>

<p>“O, that Deekens! He is an impossible!”
cried Annette, throwing out her hands with a
gesture of rejection. “Not that, I beg of you.”
Lucie made no reply but continued on her way
to the kitchen. She was gone some time but
at last returned with a green book under arm.
She showed the title on the back to Annette with
a gleeful laugh.</p>

<p>“<i>Ma foi</i> but you are a tease,” cried Annette.
“I will not remain. I will go home at once.”
She jumped up in order to carry out her decision.</p>

<p>Lucie forced her back upon the seat. “And
why am I not to tease as well as you? To read
does not hurt one’s feelings, but to be denied
one’s country does,” she said.</p>

<p>“Did I really hurt your feelings?” Annette
asked contritely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>“Would it not hurt your feelings if one declared
you did not belong to your native country,
to France?”</p>

<p>“It would most surely,” Annette was obliged
to confess, “but I was only teasing my Lucie.
As for this Deekens, he bewilders, he confuses
me. Is it because you are angry with me and
wish me to go that you bring this so impossible
book?”</p>

<p>“But this you know could not be,” Lucie
assured her. “Wait till I have told you. I asked
my mother to suggest something from her books
which would be interesting to both you and me
and she gave me this which she tells me is quite
unlike any of the others of this Dickens. It is
called ‘A Tale of Two Cities’ and is about the
French Revolution. The heroine has my own
name of Lucie. My mother says the story is
exciting beyond words.”</p>

<p>“<i>Voila une autre chose</i>,” returned Annette,
accepting the situation without further protest.
“Let us then proceed.”</p>

<p>Usually Lucie’s methods of translation were
very free, to say the least. Her way was to
skim over a page as rapidly as possible, then
relate the contents in her own words. Anything
that appeared uninteresting she skipped, consequently
the abridged tale which Annette heard
was shorn of many of its features and she was
frequently bewildered in trying to keep track of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
the plot and the characters. If she complained
of this Lucie would laboriously try to translate
literally, which was more bewildering still. Both
girls, however, enjoyed such translations as Lucie
took pains to make clear. The usual manner
would run something like this, Lucie turning
over the leaves rapidly:</p>

<p>“It was in the year 1775. There was a man
in a coach who had a message brought to him.
He was to meet a young lady at Dover.”</p>

<p>“A young man was this?” Annette queried.</p>

<p>“No, an old. He was a banker or something.
He had to tell the young lady that her father was
living.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t she want him to be living?”</p>

<p>“That I do not know yet, but anyway she
thought him dead. He had been in prison for
eighteen years.”</p>

<p>“<i>Ma foi</i>, Lucie, for what was he imprisoned?
He must have been a very bad man. Eighteen
years! A lifetime.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t say why he was imprisoned. He
may not have been a wicked person. Anyway
they went to see him. He was in a tower making
shoes.”</p>

<p>“Shoes? My Lucie, why should he make
shoes?”</p>

<p>“O, just to pass away the time.”</p>

<p>“But so curious is this. It would not entertain
me to spend my time making shoes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>“It might if you wanted to pass away the time
and could find nothing else to do. I should
think it rather interesting myself.”</p>

<p>“For me I should prefer something else;
dresses, maybe, or hats. I should not mind at
all making hats.”</p>

<p>“Men’s hats or ladies’ hats? Straw hats or
what?”</p>

<p>“O, not men’s hats of course, beautiful hats
upon which one could use ribbons and lace
flowers.”</p>

<p>“Where could you get all those things if you
were in prison?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t an idea. I suppose in the same
manner that the man got leather for the shoes.
Does it tell?”</p>

<p>“Not yet. Maybe it will. We shall see.”
So the tale went on till the midday meal was
ready and a voice from the other side of the wall
called: “Annette, Annette, <i>le dejeuner est servi</i>.”
Then over the wall climbed Annette, leaving
the fortunes of Lucie Manette, Evremonde and
Sidney Carton to be followed another day.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

<small>THE FIRST BREAK</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“MOUSSE! Mousse! Where is Mousse?”
Lucie began calling her pet cat as she ran
from kitchen to dining-room to library. At the
door of the last named room she stopped short to
look around upon the little group gathered there.
“Such serious faces, all of you,” she exclaimed.
“What is it? Mamma, papa, grandfather, you
look as if you had lost your last friends.” She
perched upon her grandfather’s knee and began
pulling his moustache so as to make the corners
of his mouth turn up. “Smile, <i>cher grandpère</i>,”
she said.</p>

<p>He took her hands gently away and held them
in his. “It is a time to be serious, my child,” he
said. “One cannot smile when there is war to
face. I who remember 1870 cannot smile now.”</p>

<p>“War? Not for us, not France. What has
she done?” Lucie looked around incredulously.</p>

<p>“She has done nothing but be her true self,”
said her grandfather shaking his head sadly.</p>

<p>“But it is not near, this war. It will not
touch us here in our home.”</p>

<p>“Alas, it is very near. The Germans have
invaded Belgium, and are marching on to Paris<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
where, they boast, they will eat their Christmas
dinner.”</p>

<p>“Oh but,” Lucie began, looking toward
her father, whose face wore a stern, set look.
“Papa,” she cried springing up and throwing
herself into his arms, “you are going! It is
this that makes you all look so. You are going
to the war, to be a soldier. O, papa!”</p>

<p>He stroked her hair softly. “Yes, little one,
I am going as all good Frenchmen will go. We
are not ready, we of France, but we shall do our
best. For this hour Germany has been preparing
for forty years. She is the one country
which desires and is ready for war. The rest
of us have been taken unawares but—” He
shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“And is it soon, at once, that you must go?”
Lucie asked tremulously.</p>

<p>“At once. There is no time to lose. You
must be brave, little one, and cheer mamma.
You are a daughter of France, remember, and her
women do not quail before danger. You will
remember that and be brave always, always,
no matter what comes?” He took her face
between his hands and kissed her on each
cheek.</p>

<p>Lucie winked back the tears and, though her
voice quavered, she answered: “I will be brave,
always, always, papa. I will remember.”</p>

<p>“That is my dear daughter. Try to help all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
you can. There will be much to be done and
you must do your part.”</p>

<p>Lucie looked across the room. “But grandfather
is not going,” she said.</p>

<p>He lifted his head with a sudden, proud gesture.
“Not yet, my pigeon, but if I am called I shall
answer in spite of that old wound the Prussians
gave me nearly fifty years ago.”</p>

<p>“And Jean, does Paulette’s Jean go?” Lucie
continued her questions.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, Jean must go,” her father told her.
“He has enlisted already in my company.”</p>

<p>“Poor Paulette!” Lucie looked grave. She
realized that it was indeed no time to make
merry.</p>

<p>And in the days which followed she realized
this still more. Her mother went about with a
faraway look in her eyes. Paulette was grimmer
and more silent. Grandfather Du Bois talked
much with his neighbor, Mons. Le Brun, of that
other war in which both had taken part. Lucie
caught such sentences as: “They shall not pass.
Never again shall it be, never, never,” spoken
fiercely. Then there would be long silences as
the two old men sat under the trees in the peaceful
garden.</p>

<p>It was with contradictory emotions that the
little girl saw her father march away with Jean,
Pierre, Louis and François, youths of the town
whom she had always known. They were all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
singing the Marseillaise. Lucie was thrilled as
she heard them. Her grandfather and Mons.
Le Brun stood stiffly saluting the flag as it
passed. Madame Du Bois made a sweeping
curtsy. Paulette followed her example, and,
in her turn so did Lucie. Her heart beat high as
she saw her father in his captain’s uniform leading
his men. There were many others on the
street waving handkerchiefs and crying “<i>Au
revoir</i>.” Old men and boys were shouting “<i>Vive
la France!</i>” or “<i>Brave garçons!</i>” As the rat-a-tat
of the drums and the singing died away,
and the floating flag became a mere speck, Lucie
felt that she could not keep back her tears.
She glanced at her mother, on whose face was
a strange, exalted look. Lucie grasped her
mother’s hand. It was as cold as ice, but she held
Lucie’s tightly and smiled down at her. A few
of the women were weeping though they continued
to cheer mechanically as the tears coursed
down their cheeks. Madame Du Bois’s eyes
were tearless, and Lucie, who felt the moisture
must overflow in her own eyes, choked back the
lump in her throat and smiled into the face above
her.</p>

<p>“They will come back victorious,” exclaimed
her grandfather bravely.</p>

<p>“If they come back at all,” remarked Paulette
dejectedly.</p>

<p>Thereupon the lump in Lucie’s throat grew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
bigger and forced from her eyes the tears which
she had been striving to keep back.</p>

<p>She broke from her mother, rushed into the
house and up, up into the farthest corner of the
attic where she could have out her cry without
being seen. Her father! Her beloved father
gone, gone! She might never see him again on
earth. She could not bear to think of it! In the
excitement of the past few days, in the glamour
of beholding uniforms, hearing drums beating
and seeing flags flying she had scarcely realized
that he was going into dangers, but now that
part was done with, that exciting part which had
buoyed her up, and ahead were only days of
waiting and of anxiety.</p>

<p>The sobs grew less and less, however, as she
remembered her promise to be brave. She
repeated it over and over again: “I will be
brave, always, always. I will, papa.” She
wiped her eyes and gazed seriously out of the
small window by which she sat. The pigeons
were strutting over the red-tiled roof, making
their queer cooing sounds. Down in the garden,
walking back and forth, back and forth, she saw
her grandfather slowly pacing.</p>

<p>Presently something soft and furry rubbed
against her knee. “You, Mousse!” she cried.
“You have searched me out. What a cat indeed!
How did you know where to find me?”
She gathered the little purring creature into her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
arms, gently stroked his head till he settled down
in her lap; then she sat there very still for some
time, thinking, thinking, until looking down
into the garden she saw Paulette come out with
two buckets and go toward the well.</p>

<p>“The poor Paulette,” exclaimed Lucie, “she
will now have to do Jean’s work since he is no
longer here. Behold grandfather! he has taken
a bucket. He is helping her. What a thing
indeed! I, too, should help; it is what I promised
papa I would do. I had forgotten all that
might happen with Jean gone, that Paulette
would have double work unless we others should
do some of it. Come, Mousse, we must go down.”</p>

<p>She carried the small creature with her down
to the garden, calling as she went: “What can
I do? What can I do? Paulette, is there
nothing I can do to help?”</p>

<p>“To be sure there is something,” replied
Paulette, setting down her bucket, a smile relaxing
the gravity of her face. “You can feed
the fowls.”</p>

<p>“Truly I can,” replied Lucie. “I know where
their food is. Come with me to feed the fowls,”
she said to her grandfather who was setting down
the second bucket.</p>

<p>“And do you think I have nothing better to do
than help you feed the fowls?” he asked, smiling
at her indulgently.</p>

<p>“No doubt you have, but it will not take long,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
and it is so much more entertaining when one has
a companion to whom one can say: ‘Is not the
speckled hen greedy?’ or, ‘What a coward is
the red rooster!’”</p>

<p>“To-day then it is allowed that you make
those remarks to me, but after this—” He
shook his head.</p>

<p>“After this why can you not?”</p>

<p>“Because, my child, I take my son’s place at
the factory, as must many an old man do.”</p>

<p>Lucie looked thoughtfully across at the neighboring
garden. “Mons. Le Brun will not have
to change his habits, but that other grandfather
of Annette’s must do so, I suppose, for her uncles
and cousins will go to the war, no doubt.”</p>

<p>Her grandfather drew a quick sigh. “Yes,
all of us can do our part in one way or another.
Well, in my case it is not as if I were without
experience. Come, let us go to those fowls, and
then something else. One must not be an idler
these days.”</p>

<p>The two went to the little shed at the back of
the garden where they found the grain to scatter
for the waiting fowls. The pigeons, too must
have their share. These were so tame that they
perched on Lucie’s shoulder, ate from her hands,
sat upon her arm when she held it out. All the
time she chattered away, sometimes to her grandfather,
sometimes to the creatures about her.</p>

<p>The air was sweet and fresh coming from across<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
gardens. Even the smoking factories could not
overcome the odors of blossoming plants, while
the clatter of machinery was less in evidence
than the laughter of children, the rippling talk of
young girls, the shouts of boys. This evening,
however, there was less of laughter than usual.
From so many of the houses had gone forth a
father, a son, a brother, a husband to the war,
and anxious foreboding filled the hearts of the
older people.</p>

<p>Lucie carried the empty basin into the house,
leaving her grandfather with head thoughtfully
bent and hands behind him to resume his pacing
of the garden walk. Madame Du Bois was busy
in the house taking upon herself some of those
duties which were generally Paulette’s.</p>

<p>“But, mamma,” said Lucie, seeing her in the
dining-room, “I can set the table.”</p>

<p>“So you can to-morrow,” said her mother,
“but now I have done it, and there is nothing
further to add to it.”</p>

<p>Lucie viewed it critically. “I can gather some
fresh flowers,” she offered.</p>

<p>Her mother made no answer.</p>

<p>Lucie looked over her shoulder as she went out.
“One must have courage, mamma, so I will
gather the very gayest and brightest blossoms
to cheer us up.”</p>

<p>She continued her way into the garden and
was gravely contemplating roses and gillyflowers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
when she heard some one whistling a joyous air.
For a moment she thought it was Jean, then she
remembered that there was no more a Jean to be
whistling and singing about the premises. She
discovered, too, that the sound came from the
other side of the wall. It was not Annette who
was there. Annette never whistled. Presently
the whistling ceased. Lucie began to arrange
her bouquet, but before it was half completed
she was aware of a pair of eyes fixed upon her,
and looking up she saw above the wall a merry
face smiling down at her.</p>

<p>“Victor!” she cried. “Where did you come
from?”</p>

<p>“Tell me first,” returned the lad, “where is
my cousin Annette.”</p>

<p>“That I do not know. Isn’t she in the house?”</p>

<p>“Would I be seeking her in the garden if she
were?” laughed Victor. “No, my dear Lucie,
she is neither within nor without the mansion of
the Le Bruns so far as I can ascertain. I have
brought something for her, but since she is not
here, and Madame the grandmother objects to this
gift, I must take it back or bestow it elsewhere.”</p>

<p>“O, Victor, what is this gift to which Madame
Le Brun objects?”</p>

<p>“La la, I have aroused your curiosity, have I?”</p>

<p>“Well, you see,” Lucie began bunching the
flowers she held, “you see I am interested in a
gift for Annette, who is my dearest friend.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>“My cousin Annette is to be congratulated,
mademoiselle,” returned Victor with a twinkle
in his eye. “Very well, then, give me a rose and
I will show you the gift, a fine rose, mind.”</p>

<p>“Red or white?”</p>

<p>“Neither; one of those delicate pink ones like
your cheeks.”</p>

<p>Lucie ignored the flattery, and held up a rose
which Victor regarded critically. “Too full
blown,” he declared. “It will fade before
morning.”</p>

<p>“I will gather one from the bush, one between
a rose and a bud.”</p>

<p>“As you yourself are.”</p>

<p>Lucie made a little face at him. “How you
are silly, Victor. You speak as if to a young
lady.”</p>

<p>“Well, you will be, give you time, and I may
not be here then to make pretty speeches. I am
but taking time by the forelock.”</p>

<p>Lucie paid no attention to the cryptic speech
but gave a serious regard to the rosebush from
which she should select the proper flower, at last
deciding upon one of just the exact maturity to
suit the fastidious taste of Victor. He nodded
approvingly as he took it and stuck it in his
buttonhole. “I shall wear it as an amulet,” he
told her.</p>

<p>“Foolish boy,” replied Lucie disdainfully.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you think I shall need nothing to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
protect me from danger. I assure you I shall.
Perhaps your rose may ward off German bullets.”</p>

<p>“Bullets?”</p>

<p>“Why not? A soldier must consider bullets.”</p>

<p>“A soldier?”</p>

<p>Victor nodded. “It seems that you are not
very original, mademoiselle. You do nothing
but repeat my words like a parrot.”</p>

<p>“But these surprises. You are too young.
Surely, Victor, you are not thinking of going to
the war.”</p>

<p>“And why not? I shall become eighteen next
month. I am but waiting that day. I have had
considerable military training. <i>Aux armes, citoyens!</i>”
He sang in a fine clear voice. “Shall I
not fly to the aid of our beloved France as well as
another? I am no coward, I tell you, Lucie
Du Bois down there among your flowers.”</p>

<p>“Of course not. No one would believe that,
but you must admit that you are young.”</p>

<p>“So much the better. I decided at once that
I should lose no time, therefore I have been
making ready. To-day I came to make my
adieux to my cousins and my friends here. In
passing I will say that I also had in mind the gift
for my young cousin, that gift which her grandmother
will not permit her to accept. Madame
Le Brun declares it shall not have house-room
nor even out-of-house-room.”</p>

<p>“It must be a queer sort of gift.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>“Not so queer. Wait, I will show you. Stand
where you are and you shall behold.” He
scrambled down the other side of the wall while
Lucie stood expectantly. Presently above the
wall appeared first a pair of ears, then two bright
eyes, then the entire head of a very alert and
inquisitive little dog, which looked around interestedly.</p>

<p>“O, Victor,” exclaimed Lucie, “what a
darling!”</p>

<p>“Speak, Pom Pom,” said Victor over the wall,
and a quick sharp bark from Pom Pom replied.</p>

<p>Victor’s head again appeared above the vines.
He took the little dog under his arm.</p>

<p>“And you are going to give Annette that adorable
little dog,” said Lucie.</p>

<p>“I was going to give it to her, but now I am
not permitted to do so.”</p>

<p>“Then shall you take it to camp as a mascot?”</p>

<p>“I thought of doing that, but I do not wish
him killed nor left without a master. You see,
he belonged to my sister who died two years ago.
She charged me to see that he was always well
cared for, and who can tell what would happen
to him in a camp?”</p>

<p>“He is certainly a darling,” repeated Lucie,
standing on tiptoe that her fingers might touch
the cold nose of the little dog who licked her
fingers daintily. “See, Victor, he makes friends
with me at once.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>“Would you like to have him?” asked Victor
suddenly.</p>

<p>“O, Victor, I would, I truly would.”</p>

<p>“Then he is yours.”</p>

<p>“O, but—”</p>

<p>“Your mother will permit?”</p>

<p>“I think so. I am sure she will.”</p>

<p>“Yet we would better ask.”</p>

<p>Paying no heed to the flowers she had dropped
in her effort to reach the dog, Lucie turned to
run back to her mother. “Mamma, Mamma,”
she cried as she burst into the room, “that Victor
is there with a dog, so darling a dog as you never
saw, so affectionate, so intelligent, and this
dog is mine if you give me permission to keep
him.”</p>

<p>“But why you, my daughter?” asked her
mother.</p>

<p>“Because, you see, it is this way. It is Victor
Guerin, of course you know, Annette’s cousin
who comes so often. Very well, he brings this
dog to Annette. She is not at home, has gone
who knows where, and her grandmother, who
does not like dogs, refuses to allow Victor to
leave this precious little creature.”</p>

<p>“But why does Victor wish to give it away?”</p>

<p>“O, I forgot to say that it is because next
month he becomes eighteen and then he can
enlist in the army.”</p>

<p>“That lad?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>“He is young, is he not? Still there are others
as young and he is mad to go. This dog, you see,
belonged to his sister who died, and he wants to
place it where it will have good care.”</p>

<p>“I see. Very well, you may take it on one
condition, that after the war you will give it
again to Victor if he wishes it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, mamma, I will.”</p>

<p>“But what of Mousse?”</p>

<p>“O, Mousse!” Lucie looked uncertain. “I
will ask Victor to help me to make those two to
become friends. On his part he can charge
Pom Pom not to hurt Mousse and I will make
Mousse understand. He may not at once, but
he will in time. I will go now to bring Pom
Pom to show you.”</p>

<p>She flew to the garden to see Victor astride
the wall holding the little dog.</p>

<p>“Mamma consents, Victor,” cried Lucie as
soon as she was within hearing, “but there is
this condition: that if you want him when you return
from the war I am to give him back to you.”</p>

<p>“That is good,” returned Victor. “I confess,
Lucie, that I am very fond of the little creature
and I shall go off with better heart for knowing
he is in good hands.” He climbed down from
the wall, lifted down Pom Pom and placed him
in Lucie’s arm. “This is your new mistress.
Pom Pom,” he said, “you must be a good dog
and mind her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>Pom Pom looked questioningly from one to
the other, whining a little but accepting the situation,
for he did not attempt to leave Lucie’s arms.</p>

<p>“Come with me,” begged Lucie, “and help me
to make peace with Mousse. Pom Pom will not
hurt him, you think?”</p>

<p>“Not if I tell him he must not. He is very
obedient.”</p>

<p>Lucie looked a little troubled. “I wish I could
say the same of Mousse, still he is most intelligent
and I do not believe he will mind very much.
He is really fonder of Paulette than of me, so
I don’t believe he will be very jealous.” She
looked down lovingly and stroked the dog’s
soft head, Victor regarding them both soberly.</p>

<p>“Shall I bring your flowers?” asked Victor
presently. “You have dropped them all.”</p>

<p>“O, yes, please do. I forgot all about them
in thinking of Pom Pom,” responded Lucie.</p>

<p>He gathered up the scattered blossoms and
followed her along the path to the house.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

<small>WE GO</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was later in the day that Annette came flying
in. “This dog, Lucie,” she cried, “this
dog of Victor’s, where is he? I wish much to
see him. Unlucky me not to be allowed to have
him! Victor has told me, the good Victor, how
clever is this little dog, that he will stand upon
his hind legs when one bids him dance to a whistling,
and that he will also sing to an accompaniment.
Is it so, or is this just nonsense? He is
very ready for a joke, this Victor.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he does those things,” Lucie assured her.</p>

<p>“The singing? It is hard to believe that.”</p>

<p>“If one may call it singing. It is not very
melodious, though no doubt it is the best he can
do.”</p>

<p>“We must teach him new tricks to surprise
Victor when he comes back. I have never seen
this Pom Pom, for you know he belonged to my
cousin Marguerite who lived in Bordeaux which
is too far away for one to visit, and Victor,
though he has been here a number of times, has
never brought the dog with him.”</p>

<p>“We will go to see him if you like. Victor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
thought I would best tie him for a day or two
lest he try to find his way back to him, so he is
there in the garden. I will have him on a leash
and let him run a little. Come.”</p>

<p>Of course Annette went into raptures over the
new pet, and was so regretful at being deprived
of him that Lucie consoled her by saying she
should have a share in him, although he must live
with the Du Boises rather than with Le Bruns.
This arrangement quite satisfied Annette who
had felt herself defrauded of what naturally
should have come to her. So between them it
certainly was not for lack of petting and feeding
that Pom Pom could feel himself abandoned, and,
as a matter of fact, in a few days he was entirely
at home, ready to show off his tricks and to
attach himself devotedly to Lucie. To be sure
he would sometimes stand at the gate looking
wistfully up and down the street, regarding
Lucie with questioning eyes when she came to
him.</p>

<p>But no more did he or his mistress see Victor
Guerin before bewildering and evil days fell upon
the town. First came troops marching through,
a thing of almost daily occurrence and a signal
for the two little girls to run out with flowers,
fruit, or cakes of chocolate to give to the soldiers,
who would stick the flowers on the ends of their
bayonets and go off nibbling chocolate between
cheers or snatches of the Marseillaise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>It had become a thing of every day to see
Grandfather Du Bois and Grandfather Le Brun
start off together to their factories, there to remain
all day. It was becoming customary, too,
to behold women doing men’s work and for the
two little girls to apply themselves to duties
they had never known before. Still they were
happy. No one much believed in a protracted
war. Those who shook their heads in doubt
were laughed at and called croaking ravens.</p>

<p>But one day came a message which compelled
Madame Du Bois, pale and shaken, to leave
Lucie in charge of her grandfather and Paulette,
for the word was that Captain Du Bois was
severely wounded and his wife decided that
nothing must keep her from going to him.</p>

<p>Lucie clung to her mother, choking back sobs
and begging that she might go, too. “Take me,
mother. Please take me,” she cried, “I will be
brave and I can help, indeed I can.”</p>

<p>“But, dear child, it is not possible,” Madame
Du Bois tried to explain. “I do not know even
if I may see him. I may not be allowed that
privilege. I shall keep as near him as I can and
shall return if he recovers,” she gave a quick
sigh. “If it be that I must come back without
him you must have the courage to face the worst,
and bear in mind that it will be a hero for whom
we mourn. Now, dear daughter, be as helpful
here as you can. Give as little trouble as possible.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
When we keep busy there is less time
for grieving. You must try to keep grandpère
and Paulette in good heart.”</p>

<p>These words encouraged Lucie to show a
braver spirit. She no longer wept, but stood
looking very grave and thoughtful. “You will
write, mamma, very soon,” she said.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, as soon as I can. As soon as it is
possible I will send some sort of message. It
may be that I shall have difficulty in finding a
proper place to stay, but at the hospital I shall
try to make myself so useful that they will wish
me to stay.”</p>

<p>So away she went, leaving Lucie waving farewells
and trying to smile in spite of tearful eyes.
She remembered that she must not be a coward
and that she must keep busy so as to have no
time for grieving.</p>

<p>“Paulette, Paulette,” she called as she reëntered
the house. The old servant had disappeared
in order to hide her own emotions.</p>

<p>“Paulette, give me something to do, something
very hard that will make it necessary for me to
keep my whole mind on it. I must have something
to do. It is so hard this parting.” She
was biting her lip and giving gasps between
words.</p>

<p>“To be sure it is hard,” returned Paulette
turning away her head. “Do I not know, I, a
mother?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>“It is not only that mamma goes, that alone
would be a hard thing to bear. She has never
left me before, but papa, wounded, who knows
how badly, and if ever—if ever—” She
broke down and was gathered up into Paulette’s
arms to sob out her sorrow on the good woman’s
shoulder. She had kept back the tears as long
as she could; now they must overflow.</p>

<p>“There, there, my lamb,” Paulette patted her
soothingly. “The good God knows what is
best. He does not willingly afflict. Yes, yes,
weep all you wish; it is better so. One must
weep at times or go mad. To-morrow, perhaps
we shall have good news. We can be hopeful
until we know. It is best to hope.”</p>

<p>In a few minutes Lucie dried her eyes and tried
to smile. “We must think of grandfather,
Paulette,” she said. “It is he one must first
consider. He will be coming home from the
factory very soon and there will be none but
ourselves to greet him. He always went down
that he might walk home with papa, you remember,
then it was mamma who was always on
hand to welcome him with a smile. I must
train my mouth to smile no matter how I feel;
it was what mamma did. Somehow I must
always manage to have a smile for grandfather.”</p>

<p>“The poor old one,” sighed Paulette. “It is
hard for him, his only son. I know; I know.
Yes, chérie, you must meet him with a courage.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
Compose yourself. Go bathe the eyes, the
flushed cheeks. Then we will make him one of
those omelettes he best likes, and you may go to
gather the eggs for it.”</p>

<p>“That is not a very difficult task but it is
an interesting one,” answered Lucie, trying to be
cheerful. “I will take Pom Pom to help. He
adores to hunt for eggs. Poor Pom Pom, he has
been so troubled to see me in distress, and has
been doing his best to ask me what is the matter.”</p>

<p>“He is an animal most intelligent,” acknowledged
Paulette. “Though for me I prefer
Mousse.”</p>

<p>“Ah, that is because Mousse prefers you,”
declared Lucie.</p>

<p>“He is the older friend,” Paulette remarked
as Lucie went off to her room.</p>

<p>There were few traces of tears upon the little
girl’s face when she returned, and she gave
Paulette a smile as she went out with Pom Pom
to hunt for eggs. “She is a marvel, that child,”
murmured Paulette. “It is not only for me who
adore her to see that, but it is the same with
others, so brave, so cheerful. Hark, she sings of
that Jeanne who is cheerful all the day, like herself.
Ah, my little heart, sing while you can.
There may come a day when you cannot.”</p>

<p>Determined not to look forward to trouble
Lucie went on toward the hen house, Pom Pom
leaping and barking as he accompanied her.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
This was a great game, for he could nose about in
the hay and bark when he came upon a nest. It
was not always the right nest, but that did not
matter; it was just as amusing to him though it
might not be to the hen who was in possession
and who would fly madly off squawking a protest.</p>

<p>In due time a sufficient number of eggs filled
the little basket Lucie carried. She might not
participate in the preparation of the omelette,
for that must be made at exactly the right
moment and be served at once, but she could
watch for her grandfather and be ready to greet
him in the manner of her mother. “Well,
grandfather, how has gone the day? Not badly,
I hope. And you are not too tired. I will take
your hat and stick. The meal is almost ready,
so come in and rest.”</p>

<p>He looked down at her keenly. She knew
what he was thinking about and opened her
eyes very wide that he might see there were no
tears in them.</p>

<p>He laid his hand gently on her head. “Dear
daughter,” he murmured, “dear daughter.”</p>

<p>She took his hat and stick and put them in
their place, then took her mother’s place at the
table upon which Paulette was already setting
the plates of soup. Neither of the two was able
to eat very heartily, though they made a pretence
of it and spoke at length of the excellence of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
Paulette’s omelette, and each tried to hearten the
other by making foolish little jokes, but the meal
was soon over, then although Lucie was ready to
help Paulette with the dishes she would have
none of it, but sent her off to keep her grandfather
company.</p>

<p>It was not till almost dark that she found him
sitting alone in the twilight, his hands upon the
arms of the big chair by a window of his own room,
his eyes fixed upon the eastern sky which reflected
the afterglow in soft tints of rose and
purple. Lucie seated herself upon his knee and
his arms folded around her. Neither spoke but
there was silent comfort in this nearness. At
last the old man put the child gently from him.
“I must see Antoine Le Brun,” he said. “Let
us keep a great hope in our hearts, my child.
To-morrow we may hear. God grant it to be
good news.”</p>

<p>So he left her and Lucie went down to the
kitchen to find Paulette telling her beads, with
Mousse drowsing on the window sill beside
her and Pom Pom curled up in a heap at her
feet.</p>

<p>The next day came a hurried note from
Madame Du Bois. She was making but slow
progress owing to the hard conditions everywhere,
but she was with friends, and she hoped to be
able to continue her journey. They must not
be alarmed if they did not hear at once. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
would write as soon as opportunity afforded, and
with this they were obliged to be satisfied.</p>

<p>A day or two of quiet when Lucie tried to get
used to the loneliness and made a great effort to
cheer up her grandfather. Between whiles there
was Annette, to be sure, and there was also Pom
Pom who was a ready pupil when the two girls
attempted to teach him to bark when they
cried: “<i>Vive la France!</i>” and to hold a small
flag in his mouth waving it when they sang the
Marseillaise. As for Mousse, he had reached
the point of tolerating the newcomer, but not
an inch further would he go. A proud disdain
was the limit of what he felt he was called upon
to express.</p>

<p>“It is as much as we can expect of him,”
declared Lucie: “Cats are always more reserved
than dogs, mamma says.”</p>

<p>Annette laughed. “How you are a funny
one,” she said. “I could never analyze an
animal in that way.”</p>

<p>“O, do not flatter me by imagining it was my
thought,” replied Lucie. “It was mamma who
said it. I think, Annette, that we must try to
make a true <i>poilu</i> of Pom Pom. Perhaps in
time we can persuade him to wear a sword and
cap.”</p>

<p>“But who will make them for him?”</p>

<p>“Victor, perhaps, can make the sword and we
can make the cap. That poor Victor will not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
have a very happy time in the trenches, I fear.
Grandfather says the modern fighting is most
bewildering.”</p>

<p>“So says my grandfather. How those two
talk and argue and fight their old battles over.”</p>

<p>“Yes, when they are not talking about the
factories. Over the top, Pom Pom,” cried
Lucie as she vainly tried to make the little dog
jump over a stick she held.</p>

<p>“He has no ambition to be a <i>poilu</i>,” declared
Annette.</p>

<p>“But he must be, or we shall conscript him,”
replied Lucie, at which speech of course Annette
laughed.</p>

<p>“Do you think it possible that the Germans
will come to this place?” asked Lucie after a
silence during which Pom Pom was allowed his
freedom.</p>

<p>“I do not know,” returned Annette, “but I
am afraid sometimes.”</p>

<p>“And I, too, when I go to bed with no papa,
no mamma in the house and wake up in the
night feeling so alone.”</p>

<p>“I, too, have neither father nor mother.”</p>

<p>“But you have a grandmother which I have
not.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but you have, over there in the United
States.”</p>

<p>“Much good that does when there is an ocean
between us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>Their talk was interrupted by the sudden appearance
of Lucie’s grandfather with a stern and
set expression upon his face. At the same
moment came an imperative call for Annette who
scrambled over the wall hastily. “We go,”
announced Mons. Du Bois, “at once.” “O,
grandfather is it—is it papa?” quavered Lucie.</p>

<p>“No. The Germans are coming,” he replied
curtly. “Go to your mother’s room; gather
together such valuables as you know she may
wish to secure, with any of your own, put them
in a strong box and bring the box to me at once.
There is no time to lose.”</p>

<p>Without waiting for further orders Lucie flew
to her mother’s room, hurriedly gathered together
pieces of jewelry, a couple of miniatures,
a packet of letters, a few laces. To these she
added her own little trinkets, crowding them all
into a box which she brought down from the
attic and which, when filled, she carried to her
grandfather. She found him with Paulette in
the garden. Both had spades with which they
were digging up the earth as rapidly as possible.
A large box of silver stood at one side, another
of papers. Lucie set down the box she carried.
Her grandfather glanced up but continued his
spading as he gave further directions.</p>

<p>“Go now, and make a bundle of your clothing,
no more than you can carry easily. Take only
serviceable things, nothing flimsy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>Back went Lucie, wasted no time in collecting
shoes, stockings, a pair of each, a change of underwear,
a couple of her stoutest frocks. She gazed
for a moment wistfully at the daintier, prettier
things, ribbons, sashes, the light summer hat, but
forbore to put in anything more than she had
been told to do. She then put on her newest
frock and with the bundle under her arm went
on downstairs, pausing to give but one farewell
look at her room.</p>

<p>Her grandfather and Paulette were throwing
on the last spadefuls of earth to cover up the
spot where they had buried the valuables. Then
they tramped it down. Paulette craftily heaped
dead branches, stripped vines and odds and ends
upon the place to make it look like a mere dump
heap.</p>

<p>Lucie followed her grandfather to the house.
As they passed through the kitchen she saw
baskets filled with provisions. In the hall were
satchels and bags. She watched her grandfather
take a bunch of keys from his pocket,
open a drawer in her father’s desk, and take
therefrom a bundle of papers which he stowed
away inside his coat.</p>

<p>Presently Paulette came in laden with baskets
and bundles.</p>

<p>“You have too much there, Paulette,” said
Mons. Du Bois.</p>

<p>“Better throw them or give them away than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
leave them for the <i>boches</i>,” she responded grimly.</p>

<p>“The chickens, Ninette the goat, Mousse, we
cannot leave them,” cried Lucie in distress.</p>

<p>“We must,” declared Paulette doggedly.
“Mousse will be able to fend for himself; he is
a good mouser. The chickens,” she made a little
dubious sound. “Le bon Dieu knows what will
become of them.”</p>

<p>“All our pretty hens, the beautiful big cocks,
and poor Ninette. Is it not possible that we
can take them to some safe place?”</p>

<p>“Where?” asked Paulette sarcastically.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. O, I don’t know, but it seems
so very dreadful.”</p>

<p>“They will not be here long,” replied Paulette
gruesomely with a lift of her eyebrows.</p>

<p>Lucie did not dare continue the subject with
all the possibilities it suggested, but she did say,
“Pom Pom will go. He must. Nothing, no
one, shall persuade me to leave him behind.”</p>

<p>Her grandfather looked down doubtfully at the
little dog crouched at Lucie’s feet and gazing from
one to the other with wistfully questioning eyes.</p>

<p>“He can walk, you know,” Lucie went on
beseechingly. “He will be no trouble at all.
I shall not need to carry him.”</p>

<p>“But to feed him.”</p>

<p>“He shall have a share of my food.”</p>

<p>“It is a long way, dear child, and we may want
for food ourselves.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>“Where is it that we go?”</p>

<p>“To Paris if we can get there. It seems the
best place, for there we shall find friends and
work to do.”</p>

<p>“And we walk all that distance?”</p>

<p>“Part of the way at least. The trains are not
running to this town, for many of the stations
and much of the railroad is destroyed. Everything
is in confusion.”</p>

<p>Lucie looked from the window to see coming
down the street a procession of men, women,
children, all sorts of vehicles, each laden with
what could be carried.</p>

<p>“The first consideration is to get away from
here as quickly as possible,” her grandfather went
on. “Later we may be fortunate enough to
find some better means of travel than on foot,
but now it is the only means. Come.” He slung
a strap over his shoulder, grasped his stick and
started toward the door. To the strap was
secured a valise, and he bore another in his hand.
He did not cast one look behind, but went on to
the gate, Lucie following with Pom Pom at her
heels. In the rear came Paulette burdened with
baskets, packages, bundles done up in handkerchiefs.
Over her head and shoulders she wore
the little black crocheted shawl which she was
seldom without. She had on stout shoes, a blue
stuff skirt, a jacket and an apron with capacious
pockets. From her waist dangled a pair of headless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
fowls which she had not taken time to dress.
From her neck, hanging by a stout cord, was
appended a bottle of wine. One basket she
carried on her head. From it protruded a long
loaf of bread.</p>

<p>“I will close the door, Paulette,” said Lucie,
turning back.</p>

<p>Paulette was too weighed down by her impedimenta
to give her accustomed shrug, though
she said. “What matter? Those boches will
enter anyhow.”</p>

<p>Lucie felt a sudden sensation as of a clutch at
her throat at this remark and as she saw Mousse
placidly washing his face where he sat on the wall
in the sunshine. “Adieu, adieu, my dear Mousse,
dear home, dear garden,” she whispered.</p>

<p>A little whimper from Pom Pom was followed
almost immediately by an ominous roar of guns.
The enemy was coming nearer. At the crash
of a bomb exploding in a just deserted street
the long line of refugees hastened their steps.</p>

<p>Just ahead Lucie saw Annette with her grandfather
who was helping along the feeble steps of
his wife toward a ramshackle carriage which
stood waiting for them. Everything in the way
of a vehicle had been pressed into service. A
woman was pushing a perambulator whose
occupant, a little six months old baby, was
almost hidden by the goods and chattels packed
about him. Mothers hurried the tripping steps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
of their children. Old men hobbled haltingly.
One decrepit old soul trundled in a wheelbarrow
her more decrepit old husband. Pigs, cows,
sheep, geese, turkeys had part in the procession.
Little children hugged pet chickens or rabbits.
Some had birds in cages; others clung fast to a
favorite doll or a wooden horse.</p>

<p>The roar of the guns sounded more and more
threatening. Fires flared up. There was the
noise of crashing walls as the company moved
on, on, down the road toward safety, leaving
home and all its beloved associations behind
them.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

<small>A LONELY NIGHT</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">FOOTSORE, weary, hour after hour Lucie
dragged herself along. The little bundle,
which at first seemed not too great a weight,
at last became intolerably heavy. One by
one Paulette disposed of her bundles. Mons.
Du Bois staggered under the valises, but refused
to give them up. Poor little Pom Pom faithfully
followed his mistress. At times he would
lie down quite exhausted but always he caught
up with his friends.</p>

<p>At last came along a cart drawn by two stout
horses whose driver hailed them. “Ah, Mons.
Du Bois, this is a sad journey for you,” he said.
“I can perhaps give you a lift.”</p>

<p>Mons. Du Bois hesitated. “You are very kind,
my friend,” he said at last. “It is not I who
need the lift, but if you could take these valises
a short distance it would ease my old back. In
my soldiering days I could carry a much heavier
weight. I tried in vain to hire some sort of
conveyance, but everything was spoken for.
My youthful strength has forsaken me, I fear.”</p>

<p>“I can make room for you,” insisted the man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>“Not for me, but for my granddaughter, perhaps.”</p>

<p>“Then mademoiselle?” The man turned to
Lucie.</p>

<p>She shook her head. “No, no, I am young
and strong. I prefer it should be my grandfather.
We can travel along slowly, grandpère,
and meet you farther on, by nightfall.”</p>

<p>“We shall not be traveling very fast with our
load,” said the driver, “and we shall not more
than make the next village where is the station.
It was still untouched from last reports and I
hope one can travel by rail the rest of the way.
Come, monsieur, better mount the cart.”</p>

<p>Mons. Du Bois argued still further, but at
last consented to accept the man’s kind offer.
The old man was very weary and that wound
which he had received in his soldiering days still
gave him discomfort.</p>

<p>“We can relieve you a little of your load, too,
my good woman,” the man told Paulette. “Let
us have one of those heavy baskets.” Nothing
loath Paulette handed up a basket, and the wagon
moved on, the two sturdy horses quite equal to
the added weight.</p>

<p>The Le Bruns, whom at first they had outdistanced,
passed them some time before, Mons.
Le Brun having been able to persuade the man
with the ramshackle carriage, for a goodly sum,
to take them in, although it seemed as if any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
moment the carriage might break down or the
horse give out, so many were the passengers.
Annette had waved her hand as they drove past.</p>

<p>“Are you going to Paris?” asked Lucie.</p>

<p>“No,” Annette called back. “We are going
to my grandmother’s sister. She will be glad to
take us in.”</p>

<p>It was something to know where Annette was
going, Lucie thought, although she would turn
aside a little later on, and her destination was
nowhere near Paris. It must be to Victor’s home
they were going. It was a pity that Pom Pom
could not have gone with them, Lucie reflected.</p>

<p>She continued to plod stolidly along with
Paulette. They spoke little. It took all their
energies to keep up the steady pace. Finally
Lucie found herself saying over dully: “At the
next village we shall meet grandfather and take
the train.” Evidently the same thought was
in Paulette’s mind, for she turned after a while
to say: “It cannot be much farther, little one.
By sundown we should arrive.”</p>

<p>“Where do we sleep, Paulette?”</p>

<p>“Who knows? There must be some spot.
No doubt Monsieur will arrange for that before
we come. There is no question but we shall
sleep well.”</p>

<p>This was comforting and spurred Lucie’s
lagging tread to a brisker one. Pom Pom toiled
patiently along behind her. Once in a while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
he stopped short, looked back, then took up his
line of march, his eyes fixed steadfastly upon the
track of his mistress.</p>

<p>At last as the sun was setting they heard a
shout ahead, then a confused murmur of voices
raised high in a clamor of discontent.</p>

<p>“What can it be, Paulette?” cried Lucie,
stopping short.</p>

<p>“We shall see,” Paulette answered laconically.</p>

<p>They went on a little farther, reaching a slight
rise in the road. Paulette stood still, shaded her
eyes and looked toward the village of their
destination. “Mon Dieu!” she exclaimed,
“there is no more a station,” for beyond them
were shattered walls, torn tracks, smoking ruins.</p>

<p>Lucie sank down on the ground and burst into
tears from sheer fatigue and disappointment.
Pom Pom crept close to her, licking her hands
and whining his sympathy. “What shall we do?
What shall we do?” moaned the girl. “I am so
tired, Paulette, oh, so tired. I do not see how
I can walk another step.”</p>

<p>“I know, my child, I know. Let me think for
a moment.” The brave woman looked keenly
around. Not far away was a cow shed which
had escaped destruction. “I cannot leave you
here by the roadside,” mused Paulette. “Let
us go to the little shed, my dear one. I can
leave you there while I go to hunt up Monsieur.
It is evident that there is no inn left in that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
village, but one never knows what may be found
till he seeks. Come, we will examine that cow
shed.”</p>

<p>They left the road, turned into a field, red with
poppies, and reached the modest shelter to find
it, if not very clean, at least empty. Some bits
of rope hanging from a nail, and a pile of straw
gave sole evidence of any former presence, if one
does not include the barnyard odor.</p>

<p>“It is not a palace,” declared Paulette, “but
it is a shelter and out of the way. I think the
owners have fled, so one may rest assured that it
will not be invaded. Rest here, child, but do
not permit yourself to be seen. I will leave the
baskets and bundles so as to be the quicker in
returning. The little dog will be a protection.”</p>

<p>“From what?” asked Lucie in alarm.</p>

<p>“From nothing,” returned Paulette with a
wry smile. “From frogs in the pond, crickets
in the grass maybe.”</p>

<p>Thus reassured Lucie took a seat on the pile
of straw just inside the door while Paulette deposited
the baskets near by, Pom Pom looking
interestedly on.</p>

<p>As Paulette started off with many assurances
of a speedy return. Pom Pom looked questioningly
after her. Was he to go, too? His eyes
inquired of Lucie.</p>

<p>“No, no, Pom, you are to stay with me,” she
told him, and with a sigh of content the tired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
little creature dropped down on the straw, and,
with head on paws, went off to sleep.</p>

<p>It was very quiet. For a while one could not
realize that so lately war had been so close at
hand, that shrieking bombs had flown overhead,
that screaming of shells, booming of guns, whir
of airplanes had disturbed this peace, and had
wrought destruction in passing this little corner
of the world.</p>

<p>The sun went down leaving clouds of flaming
red which turned to pallid gray. Frogs croaked.
Crickets chirped. Once or twice there was a
distant roar of guns. Lucie wondered sorrowfully
if it came from her town or some other.
She began to feel very hungry, but concluded to
wait for Paulette who should return at any moment.
It grew darker and darker, but no Paulette.</p>

<p>“If I wait till it grows any darker,” decided
Lucie, “I shall not be able to find the food.” She
moved over to the basket, remembering that
Paulette had supplied, for their noonday meal,
bread, butter, cheese, roasted chicken. As
Pom Pom heard her at the basket he pricked up
his ears, then arose with a yawn and wagged his
tail.</p>

<p>“You are hungry, too, poor Pom Pom,” said
Lucie lifting the lid of the basket. “Ciel!” she
exclaimed as she peered down into the contents
of the basket, “it is not food at all which we have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
here. The basket which held that must have
gone with grandfather in the wagon. What a
misfortune! No doubt Paulette thought she
handed up the one which holds the utensils.
She was flurried and the two are exactly alike.
I wish she would return so we could join those
others and get the food. I have half a mind to
go on. To be sure I could carry never these
things, but perhaps they would be safe here and
some one could return for them.”</p>

<p>It was a comfort to have the little dog to talk
to, Lucie considered as she kept up a murmuring
conversation. “It is very strange that she does
not come, Pom Pom,” she said. “Surely it is
not so far. One can see several lights quite
plainly. Hark! there is another of those sharp
reports; it is the third. They sound much
nearer than those other rumbling growls. Figure
to yourself, my Pom Pom, what it must be to
live in the midst of the cannonading as my poor
papa did. I wonder, oh, I wonder when I shall
see him, my mother also. What would they say
to behold my plight? Grandfather, of course,
will let them know when we reach Paris. It
seems very far away, that city of Paris. Why
does not Paulette come, Pom Pom? It grows
so very dark, she will not be able to find her
way. If one had a lantern or a bit of candle,
though perhaps it is better not, for as it is we
are quite hidden as Paulette charged me to be.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>Pom Pom from time to time wagged his tail in
response to the talk, but he had prowled around
and had discovered a discarded bone which gave
him some satisfaction and to which he gave his
best attention, bare as it was. At last when
Lucie had lapsed into a silence, and the darkness
had settled down upon them, he drew very close
and lay down with his head in the lap of his
mistress, once in a while giving her hand a reassuring
lick.</p>

<p>As the moments passed Lucie grew more and
more concerned. She was of two minds about
staying. Suppose she started off in the dark,
she might lose her way and miss Paulette altogether.
Paulette would be distracted at not
finding her. Suppose she stayed. It was an appalling
prospect to remain in that dreary place
by herself. She who had never spent a night
away from the safety of her own roof, to be utterly
alone in a place whose very name was unknown
to her, could not tell what terrors might
befall her. She resolved that she would keep
watch all night. Paulette might arrive at any
moment. She propped herself up against a
corner of the shed as best she could, her bundle
behind her, Pom Pom at her feet. The stars were
coming out. The frogs piped up again, then the
crickets. Presently another sudden sound of
explosion. “Paulette, Paulette, why don’t you
come? It is so lonely here, so—dark—so
dark.” Pom Pom stirred. Lucie put out her
hand wanderingly to rest it on his head as he
moved closer up by her side. Her head
dropped till it rested on her bundle, then
she was not conscious of anything more. Little
maid and little dog slept the night through.
Once only Pom Pom stirred, pricked up his ears,
sat up and listened, then snuggled back with a
sigh and went off again into a sound sleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>It was early, early in the morning when Lucie
was aroused by a sudden squawk, a wild flutter
of wings. She sat up and rubbed her eyes to
behold a much ruffled hen disappearing out of the
doorway and cackling her best. Dazed with
sleep Lucie thought at first she must be dreaming,
but the cackling fully aroused her. She looked
around, bewildered. “Where in the world am
I?” she exclaimed. Then the events of the day
before came back to her. She stood up,
shaking the straw from her dress. “Of all
things!” she exclaimed, “I have spent the entire
night in this dirty place, and have slept like a
Christian. Who could believe it? Thank
heaven there is no door, so one could at least
have fresh air. Where is Paulette, and where
indeed is Pom Pom?”</p>

<p>She went out into the field to look around.
Dew lay on the grass. The poppy buds were
unfolding. A lark sang soaring overhead.
The hen, having concluded her triumphant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
remarks, was on the search for breakfast and was
picking around quite as if all her friends and
neighbors had not been carried off.</p>

<p>“It is most strange what has become of that
Paulette,” murmured Lucie, looking more and
more troubled. “Since she has not returned to
me it is plain that I must go in search of her.
As for Pom Pom, he will not have strayed far.
I have no doubt but he will come back to me.
Now that it is daylight and I am rested it should
not be difficult to get to the station if I had but
something to eat before I go. What a thing to
have done to sleep all night when I meant to
keep watch. Well, as one may say: <i>Avise la fin</i>:
consider the end. I am refreshed, though I
would be more so if I had had a mouthful of
supper and could look forward to a bite of breakfast.
I should probably be exhausted but for
the sleep. As for Pom Pom, no doubt he has
gone off to forage for himself. What a thing to
have the nose of a dog so that one can pry into
corners and so discover food. If they had left
the cow behind there would be the milk, though
if the cow had remained she might have objected
to sharing her bed with me. I am very sure I
should be one to feel the same objection. However,
we dispose of that since there is no cow.
Neither is there anything to eat that I can discover.
One cannot feed on poppies nor on
grass. I wish Pom Pom would come. I should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
not then feel so deserted and I must try to walk
to that village. I may faint before I get there;
I feel so empty, but I must make the effort.
Anything is better than staying here to starve.
What would my parents say if they knew I am
without a breakfast altogether?”</p>

<p>She sat down forlornly in the doorway,
continuing her soliloquy. “If one but had a
piece of chocolate to nibble. If I had but saved
that which I had in my bag when I started, but,
improvident that I am! it was all gone before
night. Well, there is nothing to do but make
myself take to the road, although of a truth I
must confess I do not like to undertake a journey
on an empty stomach.”</p>

<p>She sat puzzling over the situation, when her
eyes fell on the little hen pecking industriously
around. She jumped to her feet exclaiming:
“Of course! Where there is a cackle there
must be an egg. I will hunt for it.”</p>

<p>She returned to the interior of the shed, hunting
among the straw, but nothing came of this.
There was a small shelf high up in one corner,
Lucie stood on tiptoe to look at it. There were
some wisps of straw upon it which well might
serve for a nest. She felt sure that it was from
this place the hen had flown. She tried to
touch the spot but was unable to reach so far.</p>

<p>“There is no use in trying to pull down the
hay,” she said to herself, “for of what use would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
a broken egg be, unless Pom Pom should choose
to lap it up? If I could only find something to
stand on I might reach it.” She tried to clamber
up by means of the crannies in the wall, but the
shelf was a corner one and in such position that
she could get at it no better and was obliged to
give up this attempt. Next she went outside
and began to look around for a box, a stone,
anything which she could stand upon and so
come within reach of the coveted prize. At last
she managed to get hold of a stone which she
laboriously rolled to the spot. She stepped
upon it, and began feeling around, but her hand
found nothing but the hay; if eggs there were
they were still out of reach.</p>

<p>This latest disappointment was too much for
her. Utterly tired out, faint and distressed, she
sat down and began to weep forlornly. These
extra efforts had taken all her reserve strength
and she felt sick and weak.</p>

<p>Meanwhile down the road was trotting Pom
Pom who had been on a voyage of discovery.
If breakfast would not come to him he must go
find the breakfast, was his way of settling matters.
So he had started forth as soon as he
realized that Lucie was awake and in no present
need of his defense. First he scared up a flock of
birds but these offered no special inducement,
for he was not out for a frolic. Next he scratched
madly away at a stone under which a field mouse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
had hidden, but the mouse was too wary for him,
and he gave up this sport. Pretty soon he came
to a little pool of water where he refreshed himself
and felt better. Once in a while he stopped
to look back at the cow shed to make sure that
his mistress had not left it. He stood undecided
at a turn of the road. If he went farther he
would lose sight of the cow shed; if he retraced
his steps he was still breakfastless, and it would
prove a bootless adventure. He decided to go
on. His nose was to be depended upon quite as
much as his eyes and his mistress could not get
away without his ability to track her. Victor
was quite right when he called him a wise little
dog, for in course of time he proved himself
worthy the praise.</p>

<p>It was not very long before he came upon
something which gave him complete satisfaction,
and after an intimate interview with the object,
he began dragging it back along the road over
which he had come. Once in a while he lay
down and employed himself in gnawing at one
end of the burden, thus balancing the weight by
disposing of some on the inside, some on the out.</p>

<p>In course of time Lucie lifted her teary eyes
and looked off in the direction of the road over
which Pom Pom was traveling. She saw a
small animal trotting along, stopping now and
then to get a better grasp of the thing he carried.</p>

<p>“Pom Pom! It is Pom!” cried Lucie starting to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
her feet. “He is bringing something. I wonder
what in the world he has found.” She gave the
whistle which always brought him. He tossed
up his head, gave a quick bark and seemed inclined
to relinquish the prize he had brought
thus far. He stood over it for a moment, then
concluded he would not abandon it, for he took
a fresh hold and came on.</p>

<p>Lucie ran forward to meet him. He saw her
coming and stopped to stand guard over his
capture, wagging his tail violently when she
called to him. “He seems very proud of himself,”
said Lucie. “I must find out why. Pom
Pom, what is it you have there?” she asked.</p>

<p>Pom Pom danced forward barking joyously,
then ran back to his booty.</p>

<p>Lucie stooped down to examine what lay upon
the ground. “Bread!” she exclaimed. “What
a dog!” for before her was what remained of a
long loaf of bread; evidently it had fallen from the
basket of some refugee, possibly from that very
missing basket. There remained only about half
the original loaf. The two ends had been gnawed
off and it was no better for having been dragged
through the dusty road. But bread it was, and
at sight of it tears again rose to Lucie’s eyes.
“You dear dog! You darling Pom,” she murmured,
caressing him. “What have you done
for me, and they would have had me leave you
behind! Ah, my Pom, no power can now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
separate us. The bread is not very clean, to be
sure, but how much better than nothing. You
shall have the outside while I will take the rest.
There are knives in that basket, I know, for I
discovered them when I was hoping to find food.
If one could but get at that nest, one would not
fare so badly in spite of the egg being raw.
Come, Pom Pom!” and Pom Pom came.</p>

<p>She sat down with renewed courage, pared off
the crusts and gave them to Pom Pom, who, after
all, was not so hungry as he had been. It was
rather a stuffy meal, but every crumb of it was
devoured when Lucie at last was ready to start
out. She carried only her own bundle. The
rest of the luggage she must leave, likewise the
unattainable egg, which remained to lure back
the little hen to her nest. The hen, indeed,
was the sole living creature to whom Lucie could
make her adieux. One may never know the fate
of that particular hen nor her eggs, though it is
to be hoped they did their part in the preservation
of life in that devastated region.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br>

<small>WELL MET</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was with many misgivings that Lucie
started out upon her walk to the village.
Pom Pom, however, had nothing upon his mind
after having settled the food question for the
moment. All that was required of him was to
keep his mistress in sight, but Lucie had far
more anxious thoughts as she went on. She
was now sure that something had happened to
Paulette whose devotion to the family would
permit nothing short of utter disability from
keeping her overnight. As for her grandfather,
Lucie felt that here too was another cause for
worry. What had become of him? Was she
to be left utterly alone? she who had always
lived such a peaceful, protected life? With
Paulette and her grandfather vanished mysteriously,
how could she reach Paris? and even
supposing she were able to do this, what would
she do when she got there? She must make
every effort to find her mother and father. How
would she best set about doing this? She felt
herself such a tiny speck in such a big world.
Finally her lips took to forming only the words:
“Brave, I must be brave,” as she trudged on.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
The distance was greater than she had believed,
and with no more nourishment than part of a
loaf of bread she did not feel herself any too
well fortified for so long a walk.</p>

<p>She had reached the outskirts of the town
without seeing any one. Except for the distant
roar of guns, the occasional crash of a collapsing
wall, the far-off whir of an airplane, there were
no disturbing sounds.</p>

<p>Presently a figure at last appeared coming
toward her, a man in the red and blue uniform
of a <i>poilu</i>. Pom Pom, who had been following
laggingly with lolling tongue, suddenly pricked up
his ears and dashed forward barking joyously.</p>

<p>The soldier stopped to pat the little dog who
frantically jumped upon him, licking his hands
and whimpering with delight. “But where did
you come from, my Pom Pom? Are you then
lost?” Lucie heard the man say as she came
nearer.</p>

<p>She stood still, not recognizing the figure in
military dress, then she herself ran forward almost
as joyously as Pom Pom had done. “Victor!
Victor!” she cried. “What good fortune
is this. What a happiness to meet you!”</p>

<p>“A happiness, is it?” He laughed and showed
his strong white teeth. “And what are you
doing here, you and Pom Pom, so far from home?
This is a strange meeting indeed. Where are
the rest, your mother, grandfather and all?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>“Ah, that is what I do not know. I am in
great distress, Victor.”</p>

<p>“Is it so? Then tell me what is wrong.”
His face went grave as he took her bundle from
her and looked into the weary little face whose
eyes were so mournful with dark shadows under
them. “Poor little one, you do look as if you
had traveled far,” he said pityingly. “Come,
sit down here by the roadside and tell me all
about it.”</p>

<p>So Lucie poured forth her sad little tale, concluding
with: “And but for Pom Pom I might
have starved.”</p>

<p>Victor’s hand fondled the little dog who lay
contentedly at his feet. “But my aunt and
uncle, my cousin Annette, where are they?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“They turned aside and I hope are quite
safe with your own grandparents in your town,
Victor.”</p>

<p>“Good! That is very good. I am glad to
know this, so then, if we do not discover this
Paulette nor your grandfather, I can take you
there where you will be not only safe but will
be very welcome.”</p>

<p>“That is a great relief, Victor,” Lucie gave a
sigh. “But first this Paulette must be found.
What do you think could have happened to her,
and to my grandfather?”</p>

<p>“One cannot tell. I hope nothing very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
serious. There were explosions, you know, after
the station was bombed. There are still walls
falling in the town.”</p>

<p>“And they were there? Oh, Victor, do you
think it possible that they are killed?”</p>

<p>“Let us hope not.”</p>

<p>“But something very serious must have
happened or they would not have left me all
night alone. Oh, what sorrows, what sorrows!
My father wounded, my grandfather and dear
old Paulette perhaps no more.”</p>

<p>Victor patted her hand. “Do not cross that
bridge yet, little one. I shall not leave you
till I see you are perfectly safe. I have thirty-six
hours’ leave before reporting to my captain.
It is to-day that I wear my uniform for the first
time,” he added proudly.</p>

<p>“And very becoming it is,” said Lucie trying
to smile in spite of her fears. “Such a great
fortune it is, Victor, to meet some one I
know.”</p>

<p>“Of course. That goes without the saying.
<i>Allons</i>, then, Forward! March!” He did not
say that his leave was to have been spent with
his family, and that in returning to the village
he had just left he probably would have to give
up his trip to the earlier destination, because of
lack of time.</p>

<p>As they neared the little town Lucie saw
wisps of smoke rising from heaps of ruins. Such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
walls as were standing showed gaping holes
where windows had been. Scarce a house stood
intact. The little church was riddled, only
from a niche a sorrowful Madonna looked down
upon the piles of shattered stones which lay
upon the pavement where her worshipers had
knelt.</p>

<p>Lucie clutched Victor’s arm. “Do you suppose
they have done the same to our village,
to our house?” she asked.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders, unable to reassure
her. As they entered the forsaken streets they
came upon a few stragglers poking among the
ruins with the hope of discovering some of their
lost treasures. In what remained of the church,
cots had been set up for the wounded, and here
doctors and Red Cross nurses were busy.</p>

<p>As they stopped in front of this place a voice
shrilled out: “But I tell you, monsieur, I am
neither ill nor insane. It is as I say and I
must be gone at once. You must not detain me.”</p>

<p>Lucie gave a start. “Listen!” she cried.</p>

<p>“I appeal to you, madame,” the voice went on.
“Figure to yourself a daughter of yours, alone,
stricken with terror, not knowing where to go,
feeling herself utterly deserted. It is of all
things impossible that I should be detained.
Bah, what is a cut on the head? A nothing.
Yes, to be sure I was insensible, but at this
moment I have my faculties, and I am so weak<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
that I cannot make that little journey. You
will send? But the child in that foul cow shed
all night! Who knows if she be not ill or has
left the place and is wandering about lost and
forsaken?”</p>

<p>“Paulette!” cried Lucie darting up the steps
of the battered church, from which came the
voice. “Paulette, are you then here? It is I,
Lucie.”</p>

<p>From the doorway, which was scarce more
than a gaping hole rushed forth a stout figure
with bandaged head and torn clothing. “My
little one! The blessed child! It is she herself,”
cried Paulette grasping Lucie by the
hands and drawing her inside. “Monsieur the
doctor, Madame the nurse, behold the child.
She is here. Is it not a miracle of <i>le bon Dieu</i>?”
Paulette, excited, half laughing, half crying,
held tightly to Lucie.</p>

<p>The doctor and nurse stood by smiling appreciatively.
“Tell us how you managed to
get here safely, mademoiselle,” said the doctor.</p>

<p>So Lucie told her tale which was interrupted
by many exclamations from Paulette, but was
listened to with interest by all who heard.</p>

<p>“Surely the saints had you in keeping,” said
Paulette, when the story was ended. “For
there is danger everywhere and in coming
here you might have been killed as I nearly
was.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>“Tell me of that,” urged Lucie. “Were
you badly hurt, Paulette? Are you suffering,
my poor one?”</p>

<p>“Not now so much. It was this way that
it happened, <i>ma petite</i>: I was coming into the
town. I had arrived as you may say. Suddenly
a great noise, a crash. I knew no more
till I find myself within these walls, if walls
one can still call them. I am at first unable
to collect my thoughts. At last I realize that
here am I with a hole in the head and so weak
that when I stand I am afflicted with a dizziness.
I wish to go to you, but no, this is impossible.
I try to explain. This, too, is difficult. It is
then the middle of the night, I know not what
hour. I lie down again and sleep, perhaps.
When I awake I am given food. I am better,
and then I begin to implore that I be allowed to
return to you. These, though good and kind,
refuse to permit me to go. Tell me, little one,
how did you fare in that so unclean place?
You, of course had food from the basket.”</p>

<p>“But no, Paulette, for alas, it was the wrong
basket. The one in which was the food, that
went with grandfather.”</p>

<p>“<i>Mon Dieu!</i>” exclaimed Paulette. “How I
am a stupid? What a <i>sot animal</i>, a <i>dindon</i> I
am not to have perceived that, and then I
had not this wound upon the head which would
have given me some excuse for stupidity.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>“But you realize, Paulette, that those two
baskets were exactly alike.”</p>

<p>“That matters nothing, for the fact remains
that you were without food. Monsieur, Madame,
she starves, this child. She has eaten
nothing since noon yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, but I have,” Lucie hastened to assure
her. “You will scarce believe what I have to
tell you, and will say it is nothing short of a
miracle indeed.” And she proceeded to tell of
Pom Pom’s achievement to a still more interested
audience.</p>

<p>“This dog, this very clever creature, where is
he?” asked the doctor when she had ended her
recital.</p>

<p>“He is here,” Lucie told him waving her hand
to where, on outside, Pom Pom was quite
content to wait with Victor.</p>

<p>“We must see this so clever animal,” declared
the doctor, going to the foot of the steps where
Victor was sitting.</p>

<p>“And my grandfather?” said Lucie turning
again to Paulette. “He is safe? He is here?”</p>

<p>“He is safe, let us hope. None were allowed
to remain when the authorities evacuated the
town. All were forced to leave. To be sure,
I hear there were some who hid themselves and
would not go. This Paulette, that you see,
she stayed because perforce she must. It is
perhaps a Providence which sent that blow upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
the head or out I must have gone whether I
would or not, and then what would have become
of you?”</p>

<p>“There was Victor,” said Lucie thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, Victor. La la, there was Victor,”
exclaimed Paulette marching off. Lucie could
not tell whether offended or not.</p>

<p>But presently she returned with the nurse
whom Lucie had first seen and who brought a
bowl of soup which Lucie received gratefully,
and which she felt inclined to eat to the very
last drop for it was hot and comforting. But
she left a few spoonfuls saying to the nurse,
“I may give this to Pom Pom?”</p>

<p>“Eat it all, my dear,” replied the nurse
smiling. “We can find something else for a
little dog who is so faithful.”</p>

<p>Pom Pom provided for, the next thing was to
consult Victor about various matters. There
were the things left in the cow shed which
Paulette declared she could not live without.
How were they to recover these? and where
would they be liable to find Mons. Du Bois?
Lucie put these questions anxiously.</p>

<p>Victor thus appealed to felt himself more than
ever thrust into the rôle of protector and gave
up then and there his last hope of getting home
on this furlough. He could not desert Lucie.
It would never do to start her out upon a journey
with Paulette who was in no condition to travel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
on foot, and there did not appear any one to
whose care he might intrust a young girl and
a wounded woman. He pondered over the
situation, Lucie watching him anxiously.</p>

<p>“Listen,” he said at last, smiling down at
the troubled girl, his kind brown eyes alight
with sympathy, “I think we can work our way
out of this difficulty. Trust it all to me. At
present you are quite safe here. I will go back
for those things, if needs be, but first I will
inquire about this lost grandfather who, no
doubt, is as concerned about you as you about
him. I will see if I can discover something of
him. Let us see, he was traveling in a wagon
with one you know. Is this right?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he was with Gustave Foucher, a
tradesman in our town and whom we all know
well as a kind, good man. Gustave has his
family with him, and some household goods,
yet he was willing to take grandfather, too.
The wagon is drawn by two stout black horses.”</p>

<p>“Good, we will then see what we can learn of
this Gustave Foucher, and then I will report
to you, then it will be time enough to attend to
those baskets in the cow shed.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Victor, how good you are,” cried Lucie,
gratefully.</p>

<p>“La la, who is good? Not any one really.
I do this because it amuses, it entertains; it
is out of the day’s routine, an adventure, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
one might say. Pom Pom had better stay with
you while I pursue my investigations.”</p>

<p>He went off to follow up his course of action,
leaving Lucie to reënter the church where
Paulette was busying herself in waiting on those
more helpless than herself. It was a gruesome
place, Lucie thought, with its row of cots in
which lay groaning sufferers, some too severely
hurt to hope for recovery, and some who would
never again be whole. This was war, her first
intimate acquaintance with its horrors. In such
a place perhaps her father lay at this moment.
She prayed that he might be spared and that
her mother was at his side, as she knelt for a
moment before an untouched altar. When she
arose to her feet she saw Paulette trying to
make more comfortable a patient close by.</p>

<p>“Can’t I help, too?” whispered Lucie.</p>

<p>Paulette shook her head, but one of the
nurses beckoned to her and she followed her
to the sacristy where a sort of kitchen was
established. “I wouldn’t stay in there,” said
the nurse. “Perhaps you can help here. You
can, maybe, wash dishes.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can do that,” Lucie assured her and
diligently set to work, feeling thankful that
something useful was her part to perform.</p>

<p>She was not long at her occupation, however,
for before she had quite finished the pile before
her, Victor came back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>“Your friend, the young man, has returned,”
some one came to tell her.</p>

<p>Lucie looked inquiringly at the young woman
who was in charge. She nodded encouragingly.
“Go, my dear. You have been very helpful,”
said the woman.</p>

<p>She gave up the towel she had been using and
went softly out, tiptoeing past the row of cots.
Victor was waiting on the steps. “What news?”
inquired Lucie.</p>

<p>“All’s well,” he answered. “That grandfather
has been through here. He left word
with the man who has been station master but
who no more is so because there is no station.
With this person he has left word that he is
not allowed to stop and is going on to the next
point where one can get a train, and there you
are to meet him. If by any chance you miss
him, you and Paulette are to proceed direct to
Paris and communicate with him at the house
of one Jacques Moulin.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, I know this Jacques person. He
came often to buy goods at the factory and
would sometimes come to dine with us.”</p>

<p>“He is a young man?” asked Victor.</p>

<p>“No, quite an old one, not so old perhaps as
grandfather but enough old, for he has grown-up
children.”</p>

<p>“That is well,” said Victor with satisfaction.
“So then we consider the next thing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>“I suppose that is <i>Marchons</i> again.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but not on foot. <i>That</i> will not do.
I shall have the honor of being your coachman.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean? There can be no
coaches left here.”</p>

<p>“You may not be overweeningly proud of
your equipage, but it is better than none. At
the present moment it lacks a wheel, but that
is a simple matter to adjust, and good fortune
for us, for because of this mishap to the ancient
vehicle, it has been discarded, left behind, so
to speak.”</p>

<p>“But how can one travel with but three
wheels, or is it one?”</p>

<p>“There are still three, two quite good. From
the third, one or two spokes are missing, but
that is a small loss. There must be other
wheels belonging to other carts which are no
longer in existence. I purpose to find one.
If it does not match exactly, that makes no
difference.”</p>

<p>“But do you purpose to be steed as well as
coachman?”</p>

<p>“Not at all. Behind a dilapidated house in
a more dilapidated stable resides at the moment
a small donkey who in some manner has been
forgotten, or rather he was left behind because
of the débris piled around him. No doubt
his owner fled in haste and could not dig him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
out. I passed by the spot and examined it,
discovering that it will not be so difficult as
appears to extricate the beast, so I shall dig
him out and there we have an equipage not to
be despised, and much better than a wheelbarrow
in which I might have had to bundle
you and that poor Paulette.”</p>

<p>“Not me, for I could walk.”</p>

<p>“Part way, maybe, but there is no question
of that as I see it.”</p>

<p>“What ingenuity, Victor. Who would have
thought this out but you?”</p>

<p>“It has been great amusement, I assure you.
Bravo! How I shall enjoy driving Master
Donkey. He seems a strong little beast, and
was glad to see me, the <i>coquin</i>. You should
have heard his hee haw when I spoke to him.
Now about Paulette, is she able to travel?”</p>

<p>“She is fast recovering. She was stunned
by the blow she received from a falling stone
and was weak from loss of blood. It was
wonderful that she escaped being killed outright.
I am sure she will recover even more rapidly
when she hears of our good fortune in having
such a courier as Mons. Victor Guerin. It is
all very dreadful, of course, Victor, and last
night I felt as if I could never smile again, but
now that my grandfather is safe, Paulette is
better, and I have had some food my spirits
have risen.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>“Good! then perhaps you will be willing to go
with me to recover that donkey. Two are better
than one at a task like that. Once the animal
is extricated we will feed him, then we will find a
wheel for the cart and can be off for a visit to
that cow shed that you were so loath to leave.”</p>

<p>“Detestable spot, how can you say I was
loath to leave it?”</p>

<p>“When one spends an entire night in a place
it is a sign that it has its attractions.”</p>

<p>“Stop teasing. I stayed because there was
nothing else to do, as you well know. I never
wish to see the place again.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but you will have to go with me to show
me where it is.” Victor gave her a merry glance.</p>

<p>Lucie shrugged her shoulders. “Well, it may
be that so much is necessary, and perhaps you
can discover if there are really any eggs in that
nest. That is something I should like very
much to know.”</p>

<p>It required some argument to convince Paulette
that Lucie was necessary to the expedition,
but at last she was made to realize that this was
not a time for conventionalities and so the two
young people started off together, first to get
out the donkey.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br>

<small>MORE WAYS THAN ONE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE rescue of the donkey was not quite
so easy a task as it looked to be, but the
two young people went at it heartily, Victor
removing the heavier stones and timbers which
blocked the way, and Lucie undertaking the
smaller pieces. Master Donkey, whom Victor
dubbed “Long Ears” for want of a better name,
meanwhile looked on attentively, his ears moving
in accord with his interest.</p>

<p>At last after an hour of rather exhausting
labor, Victor exclaimed: “There, Lucie, I think
I can climb over now and get at Long Ears.
Donkeys are more sure-footed than horses and
he can mount this pile of stuff and pick his way
along without doubt. You might stand there
and entice him with a handful of fresh grass.”</p>

<p>Lucie hunted around for such green stuff as
she could collect from crevices and corners,
while Victor led forth the prisoner.</p>

<p>“Now he must have some food and drink,”
declared Victor. “He must stand in great need
of it, poor fellow, and while he is partaking we
will get that wheel.”</p>

<p>“Where is it?” asked Lucie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>Victor laughed. “Ah, that is the joke of it.
I haven’t an idea where it is. I simply have
faith to believe there is one; there must be.
Who ever saw a town that did not contain at
least one discarded cart wheel in the out-of-the-way
corner of some stable-yard, or some such
place? I shall prowl around until I find it;
that is all. Do you want to prowl, too?”</p>

<p>Lucie declared herself eager to go with him on
this quest, and they started out, making inquiries
as they went along and at last coming
upon the very odd corner that Victor had
prophesied and where they found the cart wheel
of their desire. It was rather a dubious looking
affair, and its circumference was slightly less
than those on the cart which Victor had secured,
but he declared it would serve, and, with the
help of an old man, managed to fasten it in
place. Then they started off for the cow shed
in high good humor.</p>

<p>“It does not go badly, this cart,” maintained
Victor, “and as for our friend. Long Ears, he is
none the worse for having served his time in
prison.”</p>

<p>“Ah, do not speak of him in that way,”
chided Lucie. “It is as if he had been a criminal.”</p>

<p>“He may be, who knows what evil deeds he
may have done in his lifetime.”</p>

<p>But Lucie would none of this, and so they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
argued and made merry upon that same road
over which Lucie had traveled so wearily and
despairingly a few hours before.</p>

<p>They found everything intact at the shed.
Victor lifted baskets and bundles into the cart.
“Now we will hunt for those eggs,” he said,
“and we may as well take the hen, too. Some
one can make use of her, and she will find it
hard to scratch for a living here.”</p>

<p>“The eggs first. I am so very curious about
those eggs, Victor. To think that after all
I shall find them.”</p>

<p>“Shall I climb up, or do you want to see for
yourself?”</p>

<p>“I would very much like to see for myself.”</p>

<p>“Then you shall do so. I will lift you up so
you can see.”</p>

<p>Lucie looked rather doubtful at this. She
was not sure that she would approve of this
way to discovery. “Suppose you should let
me fall, or at least hold me so unsteadily that
I should let the eggs fall.”</p>

<p>Victor took her objections good-naturedly.
“Then shall I climb up?”</p>

<p>“Ye-es, I suppose you will have to,” admitted
Lucie.</p>

<p>“I have it,” cried Victor wanting to indulge
her. “I can back the cart into the shed.
There is plenty of room, and you can stand on
that and be perfectly sure of your footing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>“Oh, Victor, what a perfectly lovely idea,”
cried Lucie. And in a few minutes the cart was
standing beneath the shelf while Lucie climbed
upon it. She laughed down at Victor. “It
cannot be said that one’s footing is so very sure
after all, for the cart is so rickety.”</p>

<p>“I think it will hold out. I will stand by Long
Ears so he will not bolt at a critical moment.”</p>

<p>Feeling herself doubly safe Lucie turned to
view the shelf and what was thereon. But the
instant the head appeared above the top came
again a wild flutter of wings, and a second
squawking hen, disturbed in her retreat, flew
in an agony of fright down from her nest and
directly upon the back of the donkey. Victor
made a grab at her as she went sailing by in a
second flight, and Master Long Ears no longer
feeling a detaining hand, kicked up his heels
and went clattering out the door, bearing
Lucie frantically trying to keep her feet and to
get hold of the reins.</p>

<p>Fortunately the donkey once outside stopped
at sight of green fields and began deliberately
to crop the grass. Lucie collapsed in a fit of
mirth upon the floor of the cart. Victor came
running out, at first alarmed, and then ready to
join in her laughter.</p>

<p>“It is not meant that I should get at those
eggs,” declared Lucie. “You will have to get
them, Victor.”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_facing_86">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_facing_86.jpg" alt="Monsieur was wounded">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">Monsieur was wounded, night came, no one knew that he lay there, there
were so many. The little dog knew and he went out to find him.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>“But what a remarkable hen,” remarked
Victor, “to lay two eggs in a day.”</p>

<p>Lucie went off again into another burst of
laughter. “But, no,” she cried, “it was not
the same hen. That other was brown; this
is speckled. There are then two of them.”</p>

<p>“<i>Ma foi!</i>” cried Victor, “one does not have
to go far for a joke even in these days.”</p>

<p>He returned to the shed, climbed up to the
shelf, and presently reappeared with his pockets
bulging. “My first foraging expedition,” he
announced, “and here are the fruits, a half
dozen eggs. We will commandeer these, a
reserve for future use. We may be glad enough
of them on our way. As for those hens they
will have to fend for themselves, for there is
no time to hunt them.” He deposited the eggs
in one of the baskets, they climbed back again
into the cart, undertook the task of persuading
Long Ears to leave his pastures new, and finally
they were on their way back to the town, arriving
without mishap; then, with the consent of such
authority as still existed, they set forth on the
more precarious expedition to the next station.</p>

<p>Victor realized that time was short and it
would be a close shave for him, for he must
get back to camp at the proper hour. He
had promised to return the borrowed cart and
donkey, but in doing this, he resolved that he
must let the future take care of itself. If he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
could not return the borrowed articles in person,
some one else could, and that was all there was
to it.</p>

<p>They began the second stage of their journey
quite confidently. Life again appeared worth
living. Lucie sat by Victor’s side on the length
of board which served as a seat. Paulette,
perched on a similar board, was surrounded by
baskets and bundles. She held firmly to her
green cotton umbrella from which she had not
parted in all this time. Sometimes she used it
as a staff, sometimes it was laid across her
shoulders on the top of a pack she carried,
again it found a place on the top of a basket,
but wherever it was Paulette evidently did not
mean to lose sight of it. Having renewed his
strength the donkey trotted along bravely
enough, but the cart was less satisfactory.
The wheels spread apart in a manner that
threatened collapse at any moment, while the
added fourth caused a queer joggle, a sort of
limp, as it were.</p>

<p>“It may not be the most luxurious way of
riding,” observed Victor, “but if we get there
it will suffice.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Victor, do you think there is any danger
of our not getting there?” inquired Lucie in
alarm.</p>

<p>Victor glanced down at the wavering wheel.
“It will be good luck if we do,” he replied,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
then seeing Lucie’s look of dismay he added:
“but the donkey is very strong; we can pile the
luggage on him, then you and Paulette can
take turns in riding whatever portion of the
road we still have to travel.”</p>

<p>There was some comfort in this, and perhaps
it was as well that Lucie was warned, for at
last after a threatening squeak, and a more
than ordinarily violent wabble, off came the
wheel and went careering down a gully at the
side of the road. The cart gave a lurch, but
Victor was quick to spring out, and ran to the
head of Long Ears who seemed to have it in his
mind either to bolt or to kick out with his hind
legs. He decided upon a mild performance of
the latter feat, but his heels could do little
damage to the already decrepit cart, and under
Victor’s management he soon calmed down and
stood meekly while he was being unharnessed.</p>

<p>“Nobody hurt,” announced Victor cheerfully,
“and we have not so very far to go. I
think we can manage it. Come, Paulette, let
us have those baskets. We can strap them on
Long Ears pannier-wise, and we can make a
pillion of the contents of those bundles, or at
least of part. We can lay those on his back
first and the straps which we can make of the
reins will hold them on.”</p>

<p>Paulette was quite used to a peasant manner
of traveling, and lent a hand skillfully, refusing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
absolutely to be the first to ride, so to Lucie
was given this honor.</p>

<p>Leaving the cart abandoned by the roadside
they set off again, Lucie sitting easily upon her
improvised saddle and rather enjoying the
novelty. Victor walked by her side, declaring
that one could not tell what tricks a donkey
might suddenly develop and it was well that
one should be on hand. At last Lucie declared
that it was Paulette’s turn to ride, and though
at first she protested violently, the old woman
finally was persuaded that Lucie would be made
uncomfortable if she continued to refuse, so
she mounted Long Ears and in this way the
little company at last arrived at their destination.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Victor, “the first thing is to
discover Mons. Du Bois. If he be here I can
leave you in safety.”</p>

<p>“And if he is not here?” said Lucie with
some trepidation.</p>

<p>Victor looked troubled. “I am afraid I shall
have to leave you in any case,” he answered
slowly.</p>

<p>“O, Victor,” cried Lucie, “how can we get
along without you?”</p>

<p>“Do you want him to be shot as a deserter?”
asked Paulette severely. “He must get back
to his regiment, and he has none too much
time as it is.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>“Oh!” Lucie looked distressed. “I did not
think, but—” She looked questioningly at
Paulette.</p>

<p>“Do not distress yourself, my child,” returned
Paulette imperturbably. “We shall get on.
Monsieur, I beg that you will not embarrass
yourself further. We are not the only women
who must travel alone, and I have not a fear.”</p>

<p>“I trust to you, Paulette,” said Victor
heartily. “You remain here. I shall not be
gone long.”</p>

<p>Paulette dismounted from her steed and led
him to one side where they would be less conspicuous.
Lucie placed herself in a position to
watch the street down which Victor had gone,
and which led to the railway station. It was
there that he intended first to go. He was as
good as his word, for presently Lucie cried:
“Here he comes, Paulette, and there is some
one with him? If it should but be grandfather!”</p>

<p>Paulette looked searchingly at the two approaching
figures. “But that it is not,” she
declared. “That is neither the form nor the
gait of Mons. Du Bois.”</p>

<p>Lucie drew a long sigh. “I did so hope,”
she murmured.</p>

<p>In a few minutes Victor came up with a
stout, middle-aged man. “This is Mons. Carriere,”
he announced. “He will do all in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
power to locate Mons. Du Bois. As for me,
I find I must take a train in a few minutes,
but I am glad to leave you in safe hands.”</p>

<p>“How can I thank you for all you have done,”
said Lucie, with a look of regret in her eyes.
“I wish you need not go, Victor, but I should
like less your having to be shot.”</p>

<p>Mons. Carriere looked inquiringly at Paulette.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle means that monsieur must
return to his regiment,” she explained. “If
you will believe it, monsieur has spent his
entire leave in transforming himself into an
escort for us.”</p>

<p>“It is incredible,” exclaimed Mons. Carriere,
turning to look at Victor.</p>

<p>“But, I assure you, monsieur, it was my
duty,” declared Victor. “Are we not in this war
as much to protect our women as our land?”</p>

<p>“Well said, brave <i>garçon</i>,” cried Mons. Carriere,
“but let me suggest, monsieur, that if
you wish to make that train, your opportunity
is very short.”</p>

<p>With that Victor grasped Lucie’s hands,
kissed her upon either cheek, did the same to
Paulette and was off at a run for the station.
Lucie ran a short way the better to see the last
of him, and stood where she could have a view
of the train already to be heard approaching.</p>

<p>Paulette wiped her eyes with the back of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
hand. “He is pure gold, that lad,” she said
brokenly to Mons. Carriere. “Such courage,
such cheerfulness, such invention! When I
think that he may be fodder for cannon I
cannot endure it.”</p>

<p>“It is such as he will save France,” returned
Mons. Carriere. “We must be willing to let
them go, to die, perhaps, for their country.
Death is not the end.”</p>

<p>“You perhaps have no son to sacrifice,”
returned Paulette.</p>

<p>“I have three,” replied he quietly, “and you,
madame?”</p>

<p>“I have one and one only. He is a <i>poilu</i>
like yonder lad.”</p>

<p>“But you do not weep that he gives himself
for his country?”</p>

<p>“I weep in secret, but also I am proud that
he was one of the first to go.”</p>

<p>The train was now moving out of the station.
Paulette turned her back upon it, but Lucie
stood waving farewells to Victor, who in response
waved his adieux.</p>

<p>As Lucie came up Paulette wiped her eyes,
turning to Mons. Carriere to say hastily: “Do
not let us mention Monsieur Victor, if you
please.”</p>

<p>“He has gone, Paulette,” cried Lucie. “Is
he not fine and brave? Ah me, I wish—”</p>

<p>“<i>Cela ne fait rien</i>,” Paulette interrupted with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
a shrug of her shoulders. “The next thing
is to find Mons. Du Bois. What is gone is
gone.”</p>

<p>“Do you think it possible that my grandfather
is here?” Lucie asked Mons. Carriere.</p>

<p>“It is very possible. This young <i>poilu</i>, who
has just left, charged me to take you to a safe
place, to house the donkey and to return it
to one Jacques La Rue when opportunity came.
<i>Allons</i>, then, to my house we go and then proceed
to investigate. You are able to walk,
madame? By the way, have you been hurt
that your head is bound up in such fashion?”</p>

<p>“She has shed her blood for France,” cried
Lucie. “That wound was caused by the
enemy.”</p>

<p>“<i>Ma foi</i>, what a fantasie!” cried Paulette.
“I assure you, monsieur, that my hurt was
caused simply by a falling wall. I was passing;
the wall gives way, the brick descends upon my
head; that is all.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but the falling wall, that came from the
bombs of the enemy,” persisted Lucie. “Is it
not, monsieur, that she has suffered for France?”</p>

<p>“Most surely,” he answered. “She has been
wounded, though indirectly, by the enemy, and
so is to be honored as a soldier.”</p>

<p>“There,” exclaimed Lucie, “it is as I said,
Paulette.”</p>

<p>“La la,” she responded, “this sort of argument<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
is a thing to make one laugh, and quite
aside from our business. Where is it we go,
monsieur, without wasting more words or time?”</p>

<p>“We go to my house where you rest until
I have completed my quest for Mons. Du Bois.
If I do not discover him, then we will see what
can be done about your pursuing your journey
to Paris. Meanwhile you have nothing to do
but make yourselves comfortable. My housekeeper
will see to that, I assure you.”</p>

<p>“But, monsieur,” Paulette began protesting.</p>

<p>He lifted his hand to silence her. “It is
nothing. In these days one takes what comes
and says no word.”</p>

<p>They followed him up the street, turned a
corner and halted before a house which reminded
Lucie of her own home. A green gate
set in a white wall led, probably, into just such
another garden as she had left so regretfully.
It was through this gate that they entered,
and, true to Lucie’s expectations, the garden
was there, holding the familiar trees and flowers
which spoke to her of home. Her lips trembled
and her eyes filled with tears. She stole a
glance at Paulette whose face had a wooden
expression. She was looking neither to the
right nor left.</p>

<p>“Marianne,” called Mons. Carriere.</p>

<p>A stout, middle-aged woman came to a side
door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>“We have guests,” announced Mons. Carriere.
“See that they have everything to make
them comfortable. They have passed through
grievous scenes, Marianne. They are victims
of the war. This good woman, you see, has
been wounded, and mademoiselle here has
become separated from her parents, has passed
the night alone in a cow shed in the very track
of the enemy.”</p>

<p>“<i>Mon Dieu!</i>” cried Marianne, hurrying down
the steps. “Certainly, monsieur, they shall of
the best. I, myself, will see that they are
cared for. Enter, madame. Enter, mademoiselle.
I am honored.”</p>

<p>They passed into the house, where Marianne
bustled about in great excitement and presently
a plentiful meal was set before them to which
Mons. Carriere left them while he went forth
upon his errand of inquiry. It was not long
before Paulette and Marianne were chattering
together like old friends, their conversation
interspersed with many pious ejaculations, and
on Marianne’s part with many expressions of
astonishment. Soon tiring of their talk Lucie
stole out into the garden, finding it upon closer
investigation very like, yet unlike, her own.
There was no stone bench. There was no cherry
tree overhanging the wall over which she might
see Annette’s face appear. She wondered what
Annette was doing. This recalled Pom Pom,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
whose achievements had been made the subject
of some of Paulette’s recital. She wondered
where he was. In the excitement of her parting
from Victor, and in reaching this haven of rest,
she had not thought of much except the possibility
of soon seeing her grandfather, forgetting
for the moment all about the little dog. The
last she had seen of him he was at the station
at Victor’s heels.</p>

<p>Starting up from her seat in alarm she was
about to reënter the house when she heard at
the gate a little whining sound, then a quick
sharp bark. “Pom Pom,” she called, “is it
then you?”</p>

<p>A joyful bark answered. She ran to the
gate, admitting the little creature, who jumped
upon her in wild delight. “I wonder where
you have been,” said Lucie, gathering him up
in her arms. Pom Pom tried to explain in
dog language, but Lucie did not understand
that he was trying to tell her of his adventures,
and that he had followed for some distance a
rapidly moving something which was bearing
away his beloved master, that finding he could
not overtake this galloping monster he had
returned to the station, nosed about till he
caught the right scent and so had traced his
second best beloved to this present spot.</p>

<p>“I suppose you are hungry,” remarked Lucie.</p>

<p>Pom Pom quite understood this and answered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
accordingly. His answer brought Marianne to
the door. “Is it this so wonderful dog you have
there?” she asked. “He shall have food of
the best. If he prefers, mademoiselle, he shall
have it there in the garden. I will bring it to
him.”</p>

<p>She went off, soon returning with a dish of
meaty scraps and a pan of milk upon which
Pom Pom set to work without delay, finishing
up by licking both pan and dish. Then he
lay down contentedly at Lucie’s feet.</p>

<p>She had settled herself comfortably in a high-backed
rustic chair which stood invitingly in
the shade. It was a delightful resting place.
The flitting of birds, the hum of bees, the
odor of flowers, gave her a homelike feeling.
She was very tired, she realized, for she had
endured a rough journey, and her sleep of the
night before had been none too sweet. It was
a kind Providence which had led her into such
a spot as this, yet, she reflected, it was all of
Victor’s doing. Grandfather, where was he?
When would she hear from her parents? What
of Annette? These and other wandering questions
passed through her mind, becoming more
and more vague till finally both little dog and
little girl were sound asleep.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br>

<small>A STRANGE GARRET</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE shadows had grown very long and the sunset
light in the western sky had faded to a
twilight hue when Lucie was suddenly awakened
by a sharp bark from Pom Pom. She sat up
expecting to see a more familiar face than that
of Mons. Carriere who bent over her. Pom
Pom, as protector, was protesting against the
too near approach of any one save a member of
the family. As soon as Lucie came to a realizing
sense of where she was, she sprang up asking
eagerly: “My grandfather? Have you found
him?”</p>

<p>“Alas, no, my child,” was the disappointing
reply. “It seems that he has not reached this
town as yet.”</p>

<p>“But what—where is he then?”</p>

<p>Mons. Carriere hesitated. “That one cannot
tell at once. In these times a thousand things
might happen. He may have been turned aside
on account of danger from the guns. He may
have taken another road, a longer, though perhaps
better. It will do no harm to wait a little.
Give him time. You are more than welcome to
remain as my guest. Content yourself, my child.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
If, after a reasonable time, he does not come,
then we will see what next.”</p>

<p>“But monsieur—” Lucie began to protest.</p>

<p>“La la, there is nothing to say, not a word.
Let us go in and see what that Marianne has for
us.”</p>

<p>There was indeed nothing to do but to accept
the hospitality so readily offered, so Lucie went
in, but though her host did his best to make her
feel at ease and to declare himself fortunate in
having the opportunity of entertaining a guest
at table, Lucie felt too troubled to enjoy her meal
very much, though she realized that Fate had been
kinder to her than to most refugees. She made
an effort to appear cheerful, but her wistful smile
went to Mons. Carriere’s heart, and made him
even more fatherly in his manner toward her.</p>

<p>He left her to Paulette when the meal was
over, and then these two conferred together.</p>

<p>“I am troubled, so troubled, Paulette,” said
Lucie. “I am most unfortunate. My father
wounded, my mother lost, my grandfather who
knows where?”</p>

<p>“Take heart, my child, it is not so bad as it
appears,” Paulette made the effort to console
her. “It is much better than yesterday when
your only shelter was a cow shed and you were
entirely alone. Your father lives, we are assured,
and since he has recovered thus far we
may believe that he has turned the corner.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
Your mother is with him, no doubt, and as for
your grandfather, there is no need to worry about
him, for he is with friends who will look after him.
One must do what one can in these times, and I
have my belief that we shall find him in Paris
waiting for us.”</p>

<p>“Then do we go on at once?”</p>

<p>“Not at once. In another day, I think. We
must give them another day. This is a good place.
One finds it peaceful, restful. This Marianne so
friendly, monsieur so kind. Yes, it is not showing
appreciation to hurry away without reason.
Another day, <i>chèrie</i>. We will take a good night’s
rest and let the morrow take care of itself.”</p>

<p>“Do you think grandfather will be here then?”</p>

<p>“It may be. If not we shall meet him in Paris.
We have had that message of his. It is enough.”
And with this Lucie was obliged to be satisfied.</p>

<p>It had been an eventful day, but its excitements
appeared to Lucie no greater than those to which
she looked forward in that great city of Paris,
which place she half feared, then longed to see.
Was it there that their home was to be henceforth,
and what would it be like? She could not
form any picture of it in her mind, but wherever
it might be it was there that she would next
see her parents. She fell asleep wondering how
soon they would all be united, and slept soundly,
the “so intelligent dog” curled up at her feet.</p>

<p>She awoke bright and early the next morning,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
at first imagining herself back in her own room,
though she soon perceived the difference and sat
up, the better to observe what she had failed to
take in the night before. It was a clean, orderly
little room adorned with such things as appeal to
a young man’s taste, and she concluded that one
of those three sons must have occupied it before
he went soldiering.</p>

<p>“At least it is not a cow shed,” she remarked
to Pom Pom, “although for my part I do not
care for those funny things upon the wall.”
She was attracted by a pair of foils and fencing
gloves at which she looked curiously, then gave
her attention to other manly adornments of the
room. These, however, did not keep her attention
very long, for she remembered the eventful
journey which was probably before her, and
soon made ready to go downstairs to glean such
news as might have been gathered during the
night. She found Paulette still in the rôle of
heroine recounting her adventures to a group of
Marianne’s friends. She stopped short at sight
of Lucie and the little company of gossips dispersed
so that Lucie was left alone with Paulette,
whom she began to consider rather a person of
importance who might very well direct their
future plans.</p>

<p>“What news? What news?” she asked. “Has
anything been heard of my grandfather?”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” replied Paulette, “and no news is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
good news. As for other things they say the
Germans are still advancing and that the people
are flocking from the villages by thousands.
Those that do not flee must remain to be under
German rule. We are lucky, we, to have come
when we did.”</p>

<p>“What would have happened if we had
stayed?”</p>

<p>“If we were not killed by the bombardment,
we would have been caught like rats in a trap.”</p>

<p>“Would they have killed us?” asked Lucie in
horror.</p>

<p>“One cannot say, but for my part I should not
like the idea of being forced to obey a boche.”</p>

<p>“But do you think, could it be that mother
and grandfather have been caught that way?”</p>

<p>“Pst!” Paulette made a scornful snap of her
fingers. “Dispose of that notion. We shall hear
quite otherwise. We shall know the truth about
them before long. In Paris everything is known.
They say that one cannot wink without the
thing being known by the police.”</p>

<p>“What do we do first when we get to Paris?”
Lucie inquired, full of curiosity. “Where do we
go? Is it to a place we shall live till my parents
arrive, and will it be in the heart of the city or
in the suburbs? Shall we have a garden, do you
think?”</p>

<p>“La la,” cried Paulette, “what questions!
How is one to tell till we get there?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>“Shall we have plenty of money? Are we
going to be very poor? Have you enough in
case grandfather is delayed in coming?”</p>

<p>“Such questions!” cried Paulette again. “We
shall not at once starve, though what is in the
future who can say? The business is a thing of
the past; it is no more, and one must exercise
economy of course, but we shall see what we shall
see. Rest tranquil for the present, my pigeon;
to-day we shall dine.” And no more could Lucie
learn.</p>

<p>Though anxiously looked for, no news of Mons.
Du Bois came that day. Acting on the advice
of Mons. Carriere, Lucie wrote to her grandfather
in the care of Jacques Moulin, and then
Paulette determined that they must set out the
next morning, although Mons. Carriere protested,
and begged that they would remain where they
were till something definite had been learned
about Mons. Du Bois. But Paulette, with the
obstinacy of her class, insisted that there was
but one thing to be done, and that was to carry
out Mons. Du Bois’s orders. He had said that
if they missed him, failed to meet him in this
town, they were to go on to Paris and communicate
with him there, so to Paris they must go and
that was the end of it.</p>

<p>Their good host did all that he could to smooth
the way for them. He directed them to a small
and inexpensive hotel, urged them to let him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
know how they fared and if in any difficulty to
notify him, so they set out quite cheerfully and
hopefully.</p>

<p>The journey occupied more time than they
supposed it would, for the distance was not great
and in ordinary times would have taken but a
few hours, but now there were frequent stops,
cautious and slow advances, but at last Paris
was reached and they stood on the platform
of the Gare du Nord, Paulette still holding fast
to her green umbrella and Pom Pom capering
about in delight at being released from confinement.
They drove to the quiet little hotel
which Mons. Carriere had recommended, and
here began Lucie’s life in Paris, whether to be of
long or short period who could tell?</p>

<p>It was rather disappointing to Lucie from the
outset. The small hotel seemed a stuffy, shabby
place after the daintiness and freshness of her
own home. Paulette was overcome with fear
at the traffic in the streets and dared not venture
out, nor would she for a moment allow Lucie to
go.</p>

<p>“You? Alone? A young maid in the streets
of Paris? <i>Ciel!</i>” she exclaimed. “It would be
as a lamb among wolves. No, no, my child,
it is not to be thought of.”</p>

<p>“But, Paulette,” protested the girl, “it is so
stupid here. I thought Paris would be very gay,
and here in this dark little street where one can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
see so little it is anything but gay, and I do not
like it.”</p>

<p>“One cannot look for gayety in war time,”
returned Paulette grimly, “and what one wants
is not what one may look to receive.”</p>

<p>This Spartan-like response was very discouraging,
and leaving Paulette to arrange and
rearrange the various baskets and bundles,
Lucie went to the window to gaze out into the
street. A dismal rain was now falling, and such
little light as might be was intercepted by the tall
buildings opposite. It was not a very pleasing
outlook and there was nothing going on in the
street itself that particularly invited attention,
yet Lucie, in order to pass away the time, sat
for a long time with elbows on the window sill,
looking out.</p>

<p>She was aroused by a sudden remark of Paulette’s.
“One cannot afford this very long,”
she said. “Unless we hear from your grandfather
by to-morrow morning we must seek this
Mons. Moulin.”</p>

<p>Lucie turned away from the window and seated
herself upon a worn and faded armchair. “But,
Paulette, you tell me you are so afraid in the
streets, and how could we ever find the way, in
the rain too?”</p>

<p>“Are there not telephones?” returned
Paulette.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_facing_106">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_facing_106.jpg" alt="Sitting on the topmost step">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">Sitting on the topmost step, her head buried in her arm, sobbing her heart out.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“To be sure. We might have thought of that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
at once, and so relieved our minds. Will you
go down with me and see about it now, Paulette?
We know the address so it should not be difficult
to find it in the book. Shall we go?”</p>

<p>“The sooner the better,” responded Paulette.
So down they went to the telephone below.
Paulette grudgingly produced the necessary
coin to pay for the call, and after some delay they
managed to get hold of the operator, but after
what seemed an unconscionable time they were
informed that no response came to the call.</p>

<p>“It is probably a place of business and too
late to find the proprietor,” suggested the old
man in charge of the office. “To-morrow,
mademoiselle, in the morning, no doubt you will
find him without difficulty.”</p>

<p>But in the morning they met with no greater
success. “No answer,” reported the operator.</p>

<p>“What can it mean?” Lucie turned in bewilderment
to the old man.</p>

<p>“Probably this person has moved away.”</p>

<p>“Then what shall we do?”</p>

<p>“One would best go to the place and find out.
There are neighbors, no doubt, who can tell
where the person has gone.”</p>

<p>“We shall have to go. There is nothing left
to do,” said Lucie, turning to Paulette. “Is it
far, monsieur?” she asked. She showed the old
man the slip of paper on which she had written
the address.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>He read it and shrugged his shoulders. “Far
enough.”</p>

<p>“But one can walk?” put in Paulette.</p>

<p>“Perhaps, if one knows the way; otherwise
one must ride. A cab is not so easy to procure
these days; an omnibus, perhaps. It will be
much cheaper.”</p>

<p>“The cab, no. I will not go to the expense,”
declared Paulette firmly. “As to the omnibus—well,
that too is a venture. How does one tell
when to get out? It is all very bewildering, this.”
Always a resourceful person, she now looked
more worried than Lucie had ever seen her.</p>

<p>“Perhaps we could find some one to go with
us,” the happy thought came to Lucie.</p>

<p>“That is well thought of,” said the man, who
was a good sort and really quite concerned.
“At another time I could accompany you
myself, but in these days—” He shook his
head. “I am here to look after the business of
my son who has gone to the war, I who thought
myself retired and comfortable for the rest of
my days. But what will you? I cannot let
the business go to the dogs. It is bad enough as
it is, yet one must hold on to it. I will think
what can be done. My grandson might go; he
is at school, but when he returns we shall see.”</p>

<p>This relieved the situation in most directions,
though Paulette had many misgivings about
trusting herself to the guardianship of so young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
a lad as the little André was, and went forth in
fear and trembling. Lucie, on the contrary,
was delighted at being able to see something of
the city. The rain had ceased, though it was
still cloudy. André chattered away, pointed
out landmarks, answered questions glibly, and
was altogether a very satisfactory companion.
Lucie thought Paulette stalked along with the
air of being ready to challenge any one who
looked her way, and though she bore herself
stoically when they came to the crowded crossings,
Lucie could see that she was in an agony
of fear and dread.</p>

<p>At last they reached the street and number
which should be that of Jacques Moulin’s
establishment. It was closed, doors locked,
windows barred. A notice read: “<i>Fermez; le
propriétaire est sous les drapeaux</i>.”</p>

<p>“<i>Mon Dieu!</i>” exclaimed Paulette, “but this
is a thing terrible.”</p>

<p>Lucie was not so easily daunted. “We will
inquire next door,” she said, and forthwith proceeded
to investigate.</p>

<p>An elderly man answered her questions.
“Jacques Moulin?” Yes, to be sure. He had
gone, departed to the war. The business had
been suspended until after the war; who knew
how long that might be? Had one Antoine Du
Bois been here recently inquiring for this same
Moulin? The man considered. He shook his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
head. No, there had been no one of that name,
of that he was positive.</p>

<p>Entirely at a loss what to do next, the little
party turned away after having secured the
address of the firm with which Jacques Moulin
had consolidated. Paulette scarcely spoke on
the way back; she was too deeply occupied with
puzzling out plans for the future. Lucie, too,
though she kept one ear open for André’s
chatter, was disturbed in her mind.</p>

<p>“What are we to do, Paulette? What are we
to do?” she asked once they were back in their
rooms.</p>

<p>Paulette dived down into the depths of a
pocket under her petticoats and drew forth a
queer little pouch the contents of which she
shook out into her lap, many sous, some franc
pieces, a few five franc coins, one paper note.
She counted it all over laboriously. “This will
serve for a time,” she said at last, “and then the
deluge. At once we must find cheap lodgings,
and then I shall look for employment; it should
not be difficult to find this when so many men
have gone. I shall succeed. Oh yes, I shall
succeed.”</p>

<p>Lucie sat mute and distressed while Paulette
made her calculations. “But, Paulette,” she
broke out finally, “is it necessary to do this? My
grandfather surely will appear very soon, and
then there is my father’s pay. When he knows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
our needs, of course he will see to it that we
have money.”</p>

<p>Paulette looked at her pityingly. “<i>Pauvre
petite</i>, one may not look at things through such
rose-colored glasses. It might happen that the
affair would run smoothly, but how do we know
that your father is yet well enough to attend to
such matters? This in the first place, and in the
second it might delay his recovery if he were
given cause to worry. Again, affairs of government
are not arranged in a moment. Papers
must be prepared, sent to this one, that, and
who knows how many months may pass before
all is arranged? Meanwhile are we to sit and
suck our paws like bears?”</p>

<p>“You know a great deal, don’t you, Paulette?”
said Lucie much impressed.</p>

<p>“I have ears. I know what I hear,” returned
Paulette. “Moreover,” she went on, “who am
I that I should not work? I have always
worked, even as a little child. I should be lost,
desolated, without work. Am I to sit up like
a lady and fold my hands at my time of life?
No, no, the sooner I get to work the better.”</p>

<p>“But I cannot bear the idea of your working
to feed me,” said Lucie.</p>

<p>“And who has a better right? Did I not
nurse you, and have I not served your family
always, always.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless,” began Lucie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>“La la, if it comes to that,” interrupted Paulette,
“when I am too old to work we can settle
the score. That is finished. Now something
else. We telephone to these people whose address
you have just learned. We learn what we
learn. Then at once we look for other lodgings.
When we leave here we leave the new address
with the old one so that any may know where to
find us. That is all.” She carefully replaced the
money, securely tied up the little bag and put it
back in her deep pocket, then rose to carry out
the plans she had made.</p>

<p>At the end of twenty-four hours Paulette had
accomplished what she set out to do, and Lucie
found herself high up in an attic room, in an old
part of the city. “It is not magnificent but it
will serve,” was Paulette’s comment as they
took possession. Lucie made no answer. It
seemed a mean and poor habitation to her. Its
one redeeming feature was a window which overlooked
what had been an old convent garden,
and gave opportunity for the sun to find its way
into the room, and for the girl to see a bit of sky
above the housetops. She foresaw that this
would be her favorite spot, and that a chair by the
window would save her from a feeling of utter
desolation. “All the same I shall never cease to
feel like a cat in a strange garret,” she said to herself,
as she turned away from the window to help
Paulette stow away their very modest belongings.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br>

<small>A BIT OF SKY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">PROBABLY no quarter of the city could have
suited Lucie and Paulette better than the
one to which good fortune guided them. Paulette,
while always declaring that she hated Paris
and that she counted the days till she could
again return to her own home, nevertheless
soon became accustomed to the neighborhood
and hobnobbed with dames of her own degree,
becoming as canny a <i>femme de ménage</i> as any,
doing her marketing with an eye to the main
chance and learning where one could best shop
for this or that commodity. With her usual
good sense she had looked for work of such kind
as she could best do, and was engaged by two
families to do a certain amount of work, buy
the food and cook the midday meal, this employment
occupying only her mornings, so that Lucie
would not be left alone the entire day.</p>

<p>Many were the charges given to the little girl
when Paulette went off to her work. She was
not to leave the room on any pretext. She was
not to open to any one. She was not to play
with fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>At this last order Lucie always laughed.
“One would think me a baby,” she would
declare.</p>

<p>“One cannot be too careful,” was Paulette’s
invariable reply. “You are ambitious, and some
day you may attempt to cook the meal, and then
what?”</p>

<p>In her secret heart Lucie did cherish such an
ambition in order that she might surprise Paulette
by having the meal ready upon the good woman’s
return, so she never had a response ready.</p>

<p>“I will tell that Mathilde, below there, to let
no one up,” said Paulette as usual, one morning
as she went out.</p>

<p>“But supposing it should be grandfather or
one of my parents,” returned Lucie.</p>

<p>“That is another thing. Mathilde would
understand, yet I do not expect she will have so
good news to tell me when I return, for it is ill
news we are having now. This morning I hear
that the town where that excellent Mons. Carriere
lives has fallen into the hands of the Germans.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” Lucie was startled. “What do you
suppose will happen to him?”</p>

<p>“Who knows? With the Boches nearing
Paris it is as much as one can do to keep faith
and hope alive.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Paulette, will they really get here, do
you think?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>“They have moved the government to Bordeaux.”</p>

<p>“How fearful! But the people will not let
them in, will they?”</p>

<p>Paulette compressed her lips to a hard line.
“Not till they have killed every <i>poilu</i> on the way.
Do not distress yourself, my little one. They
are not here yet. It is merely as a precaution
that the government removes itself. Now I go.
Do not leave the place nor let any one in the
door.” And picking up her baskets she went out.</p>

<p>Lucie often went with Paulette to the little
market and was never at a loss for entertainment
there, whether it was listening to the
arguments carried on between seller and buyer,
in watching the people or in giving an ear to the
gossip of Paulette and some other peasant-born
woman. Pom Pom always went along, too, and
generally managed to pick up some bit of meat,
a luxury to him as well as to most. On the way
home there was always a halt at a church in
whose solemn and silent interior prayers were
offered up for those about whom all were anxious.</p>

<p>The little dog was great company for Lucie,
and since there was no Mousse to claim Paulette’s
attention, she too bestowed her favor upon Pom
Pom. Probably he enjoyed, as much as the
other two, the almost daily visit to the park
near by when both Lucie and Paulette would take
their knitting and sit under the trees with numbers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
of others all knitting, knitting for the
soldiers. The streets were very quiet these days.
One saw few young men unless it be a wounded
man in uniform, perhaps minus a leg or arm, or
maybe blinded and guided by some other. At
night it was very dark, scarce a light to be seen,
and it was terrifying when more than once up
from the street below would come the shrill
alarm of the pompiers: <i>garde à vous</i>, and this
meant that one must look out for the Zeppelins.
Being at the top of the house there was more
danger for Lucie, Paulette and their neighbors
on that floor than for those below, and Paulette
never failed to rout Lucie out of bed, gather up
Pom Pom and flee to the lowest floor where lived
Madame Mathilde, who was concierge, if so
modest a house can be said to possess a concierge.</p>

<p>It was one day when Paulette had gone off to
her work that Lucie was busy with her knitting,
looking off between whiles at the bright clouds
floating over the tops of buildings and lending a
radiance to a spire here, a window there, when
somehow the whole view made her think of an
evening with her mother just before the sad
breaking up came. “Always look up, dear
daughter, and find a bit of sky,” her mother had
said. “One’s soul is seldom absolutely shut in.
Between branches and roofs one can generally
find a shining piece of sky.” It all came back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
to the girl now, those happy home days, those
quiet talks in the garden. She was very lonely,
and liked the big city no better than Paulette
did, who was always declaring that the only
thing which kept her from returning, Germans or
no Germans, was the fact that Mons. Du Bois
might appear at any moment and be distressed
at not finding his granddaughter.</p>

<p>Lucie came to the toe of the stocking upon
which she was at work. This was the difficult
place over which Paulette always helped her,
so she laid it aside till Paulette should return.
This was the signal for Pom Pom to arouse from
his nap and to beg for a frolic. He jumped upon
Lucie, wagging his tail, and giving little sharp
barks.</p>

<p>“Not so much noise, Pom,” chided Lucie.
“Did you hear the <i>pompier</i> last night? I know
you did for you trembled and whined your fear.
Well, Paulette declares we would be safer in our
old home, so we may take to the road again.
Come, you must have your soldier clothes, for
you may have to fight for us.”</p>

<p>Pom Pom backed away, for this was a game
that he did not care for, but seeing that there
was no help for it he meekly submitted to being
dressed up in the funny little coat and cap which
Annette and Lucie had made for him.</p>

<p>“Now come show yourself to the people,”
said Lucie after he was attired. “You must let<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
them see that there is a <i>poilu</i> here to help in
the defense of the city.”</p>

<p>She carried him over to the open window and
held him so he stood upright upon his hind legs,
though he did not like this one little bit, and began
to whine his protests. Lucie expostulated
with him. “I am surprised at you, Pom Pom;
a soldier of France, a <i>poilu</i>, to act as if he were
afraid. That is no way to behave. You were
brave enough when we were on the road. Here,
here, show how you can sing the Marseillaise:
‘<i>Aux armes, citoyens</i>.’”</p>

<p>A very shrill, high-pitched whine was Pom
Pom’s accompaniment to Lucie’s song, the whine
increasing in shrillness as the song proceeded.</p>

<p>Presently Lucie was aware of an audience, for
she heard a mirthful laugh, and looking across
to the next window she saw the head of a bright-eyed
little girl.</p>

<p>“How he is amusing, this dog,” said the child.
“Is he yours, and what is his name?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he is mine and he is called Pom Pom,”
Lucie replied.</p>

<p>“He must be much company for you.”</p>

<p>“Certainly I should be very lonely without
him. I do not know in fact what would become
of me without him when I am here so long
alone.”</p>

<p>“Why are you alone?”</p>

<p>“Because I have no brothers or sisters. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
know no one here in Paris. My father has gone
to the war. My mother has gone to the hospital
where he lies wounded. My grandfather has
lost himself on the road to this city, and I have
arrived here with only our old servant, Paulette.
We were obliged to leave our home, you see,
when the Germans came.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but you are better off than I am, for your
parents are still living. My dear papa was killed
in the war, and my mamma died, the little baby
too; it was such a little baby, and she was too ill
to make such a long journey on foot. I am here
with the old aunt of my father, and we lodge with
a friend of hers. They must both go to work
every day, so I am also alone. It is very <i>triste</i>,
this place, is it not? One misses so many things,
particularly the animals and the garden.”</p>

<p>“You mean this Paris? You do not belong
here then?”</p>

<p>“No, I come from Picardy.”</p>

<p>“Then we are comrades,” cried Lucie, “for I
come from the Aisne district, and like you I
have left my home to come to this place of
refuge. What is your name?”</p>

<p>“I am called Odette, Odette Moreau.”</p>

<p>“And I am Lucie Du Bois.”</p>

<p>“I wish I could come to see you and your dog,”
said Odette.</p>

<p>Lucie hesitated a moment, remembering Paulette’s
charges, but she managed to get around<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
the subject by saying: “Why can’t you? When
Paulette comes back she will permit me to open
the door, though while she is out I may not.”</p>

<p>Odette laughed. “My case is even worse, for
I am locked in.”</p>

<p>“Then when those old ones return we can
visit, I hope.”</p>

<p>“I shall like that. Do you not think you’d
better take in your dog? The police do not
allow us to place anything on the window sill,
you know.”</p>

<p>“But Pom Pom is not a thing,” returned Lucie
laughing; “I consider him a person.”</p>

<p>Odette laughed in response but drew in her
head and Lucie did the same. Paulette would
not return for another hour, during which time
would hang heavy on her hands. She wished
that Paulette were not so particular, and that
Odette’s guardians were not such exacting ones.
“There could not be the slightest objection to
my opening the door to Odette, that I know,”
she said to Pom Pom. “If only she could get
out I certainly would do it. Hark! What is
that?”</p>

<p>Pom Pom pricked up his ears and growled at
a sharp noise which seemed to come from the next
room.</p>

<p>“Hush, Pom Pom; it is not possible to find
out what that is when you make such a fuss,”
said Lucie. “It cannot be a bird, yet what else?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
Certainly that is something tapping on the window.
I will go and peep. Softly now, softly.”</p>

<p>She tiptoed to the next room, and saw pressed
against the window pane the merry face of
Odette. In another moment the window was
opened and in slipped the little neighbor.</p>

<p>Lucie looked at her in amazement. “How in
the world did you get here?” she asked.</p>

<p>Odette laughed. “It was not so difficult. I
could not open my door and you were not permitted
to open yours, so I told myself that
one must contrive another way. There was
nothing said about windows, you perceive,
therefore I come by way of windows.”</p>

<p>“But how?” repeated Lucie.</p>

<p>“Where there are trap doors, roofs, and
gutters it is easy to one who is used to climbing,”
returned Odette with a little shrug of the
shoulders and a nonchalant air.</p>

<p>“So then you climbed through a trap door,
down the roof, made your way across a gutter
and dropped down on the balcony outside there.
I don’t see how you had the courage. I can
climb trees but when it comes to a thing like this—”
Lucie shook her head in sheer wonder at the
audacity of it.</p>

<p>“I am not one to lose my head,” returned
Odette serenely.</p>

<p>“But if you had fallen.”</p>

<p>“I should have been killed, instantly. What<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
matter? One must die sooner or later, and at
least I have no one to grieve for me. So much
the sooner would I meet my father and mother
again. Now I shall stay till those old ones
return and we shall tell each other of what has
been, and what has come to us in these sad days.”</p>

<p>But Lucie’s thoughts were still upon Odette’s
daring deed. “Suppose you had been seen
from the street; the police would have come
dashing in, and then—”</p>

<p>“But I was not upon the window sill,” interrupted
Odette laughing. “Moreover, I was not
seen, for at this moment every one eats and there
were few to look up, for those who were not indoors
eating were thinking of what they should
eat, and one does not look for food in the skies or
on roofs. No, I assure you, I was quite safe.”</p>

<p>So the subject was dismissed and Lucie led
the way into her little room, saying, “It is more
pleasant here by my window. We will sit here
and tell of our adventures.”</p>

<p>“And will the little dog sit in my lap? I had a
dear dog at home but he is also dead, killed by a
bomb, they said. It was strange that I did not
weep when I was told, but I think I had no more
tears. I shed them all when my mother died.”
Into the child’s brown eyes came a haunted look,
as if she were seeing things beyond power of
words to tell. She was a slightly built, thin little
creature, not so tall as Lucie and of darker skin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>The tears came to Lucie’s eyes as she lifted
Pom Pom into her visitor’s lap. The dog looked
inquiringly at his mistress but seemed to understand
that he was to remain, and was very quiet
under the caressing touch of Odette’s hand.</p>

<p>“We had a little farm,” Odette went on,
“and we were very happy, but I shall never see
that home again, for it does not exist. There
is nothing there, nothing but deep holes in the
ground, no trees, no house, no barn; all is
destroyed, the house and barn burned, the trees
cut down, the fields plowed up by bullets and
bombs. There is nothing to go back to, and no
one is there. Oh, I know, for I have heard my
aunt tell it over and over again, and when I shut
my eyes at night I can imagine it, that horrible
place of holes where no one lives. I do not
wish to see it, but sometimes I dream of my home,
yet when I wake I know it is only a dream,
only a dream.” She shook her head mournfully,
and the tragic expression in her eyes deepened.
In another moment, however, she tossed up her
head with a gesture of defiance. “I will not
think of it. I will think only of France, and of
her soldiers. You have a soldier papa. Tell
me of him and of your home.”</p>

<p>“My papa is a captain. He went at once.
He was wounded, but at last news he was improving.
Paulette managed to find out this,
and we are now trying to get word of my mamma,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
and of my grandfather. We expected to find
my grandfather here in Paris, but he has not
come and those good ladies at the <i>ouvroir</i> are
trying to find out what has become of him.
Our home was not a farm but in a small town
where my father had a factory as his father had
before him. We are afraid all is destroyed, but
we do not know. We had a pretty garden and
such pleasant neighbors. I hope, oh, I do hope
all is not destroyed, and that we can go back.
I cannot imagine being happy anywhere else.”</p>

<p>Odette looked at her compassionately. “It
seems that you are very young,” she said. “Me,
I feel so old. I think I have lived many years in
a few weeks, and yet I am only fifteen.”</p>

<p>“And I only a year younger,” Lucie said.
“Why do I seem so young to you, Odette?”</p>

<p>“Because you still have things to expect, to
hope for. I have nothing, because all has been
taken.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but Odette!”</p>

<p>“La, la, let us not speak of it. I shall laugh
and be gay, very gay like the soldiers. Is it
for the soldiers you are knitting?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I cannot do the toe of my sock
without Paulette. I am very stupid about
it.”</p>

<p>“Ah, that is where I can help you, for I have
been knitting socks for so long a time I cannot
remember when I began it. Give me your knitting,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
I shall like to work upon it.” She took the
sock which Lucie handed to her, and at once
made the needles fly so fast that Lucie looked on
in admiration.</p>

<p>“What a brisk worker,” exclaimed the latter.
“You are very clever, Odette.”</p>

<p>“Oh, not at all. I do everything at a gallop;
it has always been my way. Where is it that
your father is?”</p>

<p>“Somewhere in the provinces, Paulette said,
and he will then be sent to another place where
the convalescents are. Paulette is so timid,
so afraid in this Paris that she will not venture
anywhere that she is not obliged to go, neither
will she allow me to go. I think there may be
places where one could find out things, but we
are ignorant of them, and can only do so much.”</p>

<p>Odette nodded understandingly. “We of the
country are afraid in this city so large. Me,
when the time comes I shall go back to the
country, somewhere in the country. I know not
where; so says my aunt and so say I.”</p>

<p>“Hark,” said Lucie, jumping up, “there comes
Paulette. She may seem severe, but she is
kind, oh, so kind, and you will not mind when
she looks at you sharply; it is her way, that is
all.”</p>

<p>“One knows the way of these old ones,” returned
Odette imperturbably, going on with her
knitting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>Paulette came to the door, and, as Lucie had
warned, looked sharply at the little visitor.
“And pray who is this?” she asked.</p>

<p>“It is our next door neighbor, Odette Moreau.”</p>

<p>“Then you have opened the door to her,”
Paulette said this disapprovingly.</p>

<p>Odette looked up with a mischievous smile.</p>

<p>“That she did not, Madame,” she said.</p>

<p>“One cannot open it without a key,” said
Paulette, shaking her head, “and there is no
other way of entering.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but there is, Madame, and I took that
way.” There was such a roguish look in Odette’s
eyes that Lucie laughed.</p>

<p>“You are mocking me, and trying to deceive
me, but me, I am not one to be deceived even in
this so great city,” declared Paulette.</p>

<p>“But I am not deceiving you,” protested
Odette, “and if you wish to know how I entered
I will tell you that it was by the window.”</p>

<p>“The window!” Paulette gazed at the window
of the little room as if she expected to see at least
a ladder there.</p>

<p>“Not this one, but that in the other room,”
Odette went on. “There is a small balcony
there if you remember.”</p>

<p>“But one cannot reach it except from the
room. That is a poor method, mademoiselle, of
getting out of a bad situation.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>“There are airplanes and balloons.” Odette
placidly kept on with the knitting while Paulette’s
sharp eyes noted the rapidity with which
she made the needles fly.</p>

<p>“But that is absurd,” said the good woman.</p>

<p>“This is but a ruse,” She turned to Lucie.
“I desire to know how this young person came
to find her way in here.”</p>

<p>“It is as she said; she came by the window,”
Lucie told her with a smile.</p>

<p>“But this is too ridiculous,” declared Paulette,
walking off with a troubled look.</p>

<p>“Come back! Come back, and we will tell you
all about it.” Lucie ran after her. “She was
lonely, this poor little Odette, shut up, locked in
indeed. We saw each other from the window,
and when we learned that we were both refugees
and both from Picardy, figure to yourself how
easy it was to become acquainted. I might not
open my door; she could not unlock hers, for her
aunt has taken the key. Oh, she is clever and
very brave, this Odette. What do you think she
did? She climbed through a trap door upon the
roof, and dropped as easily as a bird upon the
balcony. She tapped upon the window; I heard
her and let her in.” Then before Paulette could
censure, Lucie hastened to continue her story.
“And, Paulette, it is so sad; there is her father
dead upon the battlefield, her home burned to
the ground. Her poor mother with her little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
baby died on the way when they were escaping
from the Germans. Think of being shut up
alone with such memories. Do you wonder that
she longed for some one to speak to?”</p>

<p>Paulette sighed. “It was a great risk and
altogether wrong,” she said, “but I do not wonder,
and since she is here she must stay till she
can get back.” In her secret heart she admired
the reckless deed quite as much as she did the
expert way in which Odette handled the knitting
needles. Therefore back she went to speak more
graciously to the little neighbor, and to bid her
welcome.</p>

<p>This was the beginning of an acquaintance,
the result of which none of them foresaw, nor
did they dream of the part little Odette should
have in their lives.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

<small>SHOES</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AFTER this there was not a day passed that
Lucie and Odette were not together, for
while Odette belonged to the peasant class and
Lucie to the bourgeois, this was no time for
distinctions, and Paulette countenanced the
acquaintance not only because Odette was a
well-behaved young person, but because the
two little girls were lonely and were companions
in misery. Besides all this Odette was so alert
and capable, knew so much of domestic affairs,
that Paulette was convinced in time that she
could trust the two girls to cook a meal, and
to do many of the things which heretofore
she had never admitted could be done by any
one but herself. Like most in her walk of life,
Paulette was suspicious, and must satisfy herself
as to the character of those neighbors with
whom Odette lived.</p>

<p>“They are old, those two next door,” she
reported to Lucie the day after Odette’s first
visit.</p>

<p>“As old as you, Paulette?” asked Lucie
innocently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>“As old as I? <i>Ma foi</i>, one would suppose
me an ancient, I who have a young son no
older than eighteen. Those two could be my
mother.”</p>

<p>“Both of them? It would be funny to have
two mothers,” replied Lucie mischievously.</p>

<p>“Zut!” exclaimed Paulette contemptuously.
“It is this city, no doubt, which teaches you
to be so witty. I repeat they are of an age
when I might be a daughter to either one. They
are given work at the <i>ouvroir</i> of <i>les Dames
Americaine</i>, but very little pay; three francs a
day the two of them receive, but they maintain
that it suffices. For me I make more, yet it
is well to remember this <i>ouvroir</i>. One never
knows what may happen. They have no allotment
to depend upon, those two poor old bodies,
for they have not a son in the army, as I
have.”</p>

<p>“I have a father, should not I have an allotment?”
asked Lucie.</p>

<p>“It goes to your mother, of course,” returned
Paulette. “Do not worry over that; you are
too young. We have enough, perhaps we do not
feast, but at least we do not starve.” She
paused to give herself up to meditating upon
what Lucie had suggested, then she broke out
with: “And even supposing there were an
allotment for you, it would be small enough,
and how would one go about getting it for you?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
It is not for me to say, and we had better think
no more about it.”</p>

<p>“I like that Odette,” remarked Lucie, “and
I am very glad she is so near that I can see
her every day. Did you ask her aunt if she
would let her come?”</p>

<p>“I asked, yes, for they seem respectable,
though they were horrified to discover what
the child had done, and no wonder. She has
always been very venturesome, said the aunt.
‘I call it more than venturesome; I call it
foolhardy,’ said the other.”</p>

<p>“And what do you call it?” asked Lucie.</p>

<p>Paulette shrugged her shoulders. “It is as
one looks at those things. For you I should
call it imbecile, for this other who is as thin and
lithe as a monkey it is another thing, I would
not have her do it again, but for this once it
shows what she is made of. She would not
hesitate, that one. If she saw a thing must
be done, she would do it without delay.”</p>

<p>“I like that,” returned Lucie. “It is as our
soldiers do.”</p>

<p>“And as the wives of soldiers must do,”
which remark showed Lucie that Odette was
approved.</p>

<p>It was the very next day that Paulette came
home with a long face. She put down her
basket with a heavy sigh, and paid no attention
to Pom Pom’s joyous greetings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>“What is it, Paulette?” asked Lucie anxiously.
“Are you ill?”</p>

<p>“In mind; not body.”</p>

<p>“But why? What has happened? Don’t
tell me, Paulette, that there is some new misfortune.”</p>

<p>“It is a misfortune that I am deprived of the
means of earning a fair living. Madame Lemercier
is leaving the city to-day and Madame
Gouraud goes next week. They fear to remain,
and are going to the south where they
have friends.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Paulette, what are we to do? I did
not expect that I should be hearing such news
as this.”</p>

<p>“Nor did I expect, when I spoke of those
old ones and the <i>ouvroir</i> which is helping them,
that Paulette Ribot might have to accept
charity from the hands of strangers. But she
will not, no, she will not, if there is work for her
in this city. To-morrow begins the search for
it.”</p>

<p>“Those two for whom you have been working,
Madame Lemercier and Madame Gouraud,
did they know of no one who would like a
<i>femme de ménage</i>?”</p>

<p>“<i>Hélas!</i> they did not. I asked, of course,
but what would you when they were all absorbed
in their preparations for leaving? No, what
comes to one must be first sought for.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>Lucie sighed. “I wish there were something
I could do, for soon my shoes will be gone, and
yours, too, my Paulette; then we shall want
warm things for the winter.”</p>

<p>“It will not be difficult if one can get work,
for I still have a little hoard and there is Jean’s
allotment when it comes. Do not be uneasy,
my child. I begin to-morrow to hunt the city
over for employment.”</p>

<p>“But, Paulette, you do not know the city,
and you are afraid to go anywhere except in
those streets with which you are acquainted.”</p>

<p>Paulette puffed out her cheeks and threw
back her head. “Zut!” she exclaimed.
“Have I then less courage than that little
skinny ape of a child next door? Rest tranquil,
<i>chérie</i>; I shall arrive.”</p>

<p>There was a great noise of shouting and cheering
in the street at that moment. Lucie ran
to the window to see. “Come, Paulette,” she
cried. “Something is going on. A victory!
Yes, it is a victory! Don’t you hear them
shouting: ‘<i>Vive la France</i>,’ and ‘<i>Vive Joffre</i>’?
Let us go down and see.”</p>

<p>“<i>Bien</i>,” responded Paulette laconically, putting
up her knitting.</p>

<p>So, down the gloomy stairway they went to
the street, where people were gathered in knots,
all talking, exclaiming. “Is it then a victory
at last?” inquired Paulette.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>“A victory indeed,” the nearest woman told
her. “They have driven those Boches across
the Marne. We are safe.”</p>

<p>Paulette looked down at Lucie, who was
eagerly listening, “If those silly donkeys of
women had but waited another day,” she said,
“I would still be holding my job.”</p>

<p>“They will come back, perhaps, when they
know.”</p>

<p>“Not they. They have hearts of chickens,
rabbits, those two.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless the news of the victory of the
Marne did encourage the good woman and she
started out the next morning declaring that good
luck was with them and that she would come
back with work to do. It was very late when
she did return, weary and with downcast countenance.
She shook her head when Lucie
asked what success. “They are so many,
these refugees,” she said, “and all must be fed,
must have employment. In that St. Sulpice
it is like a village, and one meets groups of
them on the street with a look as of those lost.
So many, so many, and we are also refugees.
One more day of this and I go to the country.
I care not where. I can work in the fields.”</p>

<p>But the next day she came home with better
reports. She had found work, but it would
keep her all day, and what would Lucie do?</p>

<p>“I shall have Odette and we can manage,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
declared Lucie sturdily. “She can teach me
how to cook and I can then have the meal ready
when you come.”</p>

<p>“Tst! Tst!” cried Paulette. “Two children
instead of one to set the house on fire.”</p>

<p>“But Odette, she is very clever, as clever as
a woman. I can tell that. I wish you could
see what she has been doing to-day. Wait, I
will ask her to show you.” She ran off to bring
in the little neighbor, who came, work in hand.
“Look at this,” cried Lucie, taking it from her.</p>

<p>Paulette received into her hand a white
satin shoe. She looked at it contemptuously.
“Is mademoiselle then attending a ball?” she
asked sarcastically.</p>

<p>Odette handed her the mate to the shoe;
this she was covering neatly with black cloth. “I
needed shoes,” she said. “There was but this
pair at the <i>ouvroir</i>, but Mademoiselle said I
could have them. I think she too wondered
what I would do with them. I shall wear
them and show her. She will be surprised,
that young American lady. The cloth I begged
from the bag of the old lady who is friend of
my aunt.”</p>

<p>“Is she not clever?” said Lucie.</p>

<p>“She will do,” responded Paulette, but after
this no more was said of fire due to carelessness
on Odette’s part, and the next morning Paulette
started forth to work. It was in a laundry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
and she did not like it, but never a word did
she say to Lucie about that.</p>

<p>So the days went by, and Lucie learned a
great many things. Odette taught her to make
an excellent <i>potage</i>, though more often it was a
<i>soupe maigre</i> which they were obliged to have.
Paulette took a modest lunch with her, for she
did not get back till night, and the two little
girls had their meal together. Paulette arranged
that they should go to market with
Mathilde, under whose instructions Lucie became
an expert buyer, and although she was
always busy she was the happier for it.</p>

<p>At night the streets were dark; there was
no rattle of omnibuses, no shops open, window
curtains drawn, even the street cars darkened
by blinds. It was not like the Paris of which
Lucie had dreamed in those early days.</p>

<p>Out of this darkness one evening came a
welcome visitor. It was Pom Pom who first
recognized the step on the stair. He sniffed
at the crack of the door, then began to whine
excitedly, running first to Lucie and then to
Paulette, imploring in his language to be let
out.</p>

<p>“What in the world is the matter with the
little beast?” said Paulette.</p>

<p>“Shall I let him out?”</p>

<p>“No; it is a stray cat which has come in, no
doubt. He does not like stray cats; he is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
clever, however, and recognizes friends. He
never disturbs that big cat of Mathilde.”</p>

<p>“He certainly is making a great fuss,” remarked
Lucie as Pom Pom became more and
more frantic. “Ah, there is a knock at the
door; it is a person and not a cat. Shall I go?”</p>

<p>“Not at all. I will go.” Although she was
quite ready to scold Lucie, when she thought
occasion required, and the two lived as equals,
Paulette never forgot the proprieties when
necessary. It was her place to go to the door,
and she went. For a moment she started at
the soldier standing there in his red trousers
and blue coat. The light was dim and until
he spoke she did not recognize him. “Monsieur
Victor!” she then cried.</p>

<p>Then Lucie, who had vainly tried to hold
Pom Pom, sprang to her feet, but she could not
outdistance the little dog, who seemed to reach
his master at one bound.</p>

<p>“I am right, then,” said Victor’s hearty voice.
“There would be no mistaking Pom Pom even
if I saw no one else. How are you, Paulette?
How is Mlle. Lucie? <i>Ciel!</i> but I have had a
time finding you!”</p>

<p>“And how did you find us?” asked Lucie,
giving him both hands while he kissed her on
either cheek.</p>

<p>“Through our good friend, Mons. Carriere.
You know the Germans were driven from his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
village and when we entered I looked him up.
He told me that he had directed you to a certain
hotel, the name of which I stowed away in my
memory. I found it closed, but I learned where I
should find the family of the former proprietor;
he, poor fellow, has been killed on the front.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed Lucie. “The poor old
father, and little André, I am so sorry for them.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, of course,” said Victor hastily.
“So then I learned your address and came to
find you.”</p>

<p>“But have you received none of my letters?”
asked Lucie.</p>

<p>“Not one.”</p>

<p>“How unfortunate! Then I suppose one may
believe that none of my letters have reached
their destinations, those to my father, my
mother, Annette. To my dear grandfather I
could not write because I do not know where
he is. That is the thing I wish first to know,
Victor. Have you heard anything of my grandfather?
Mons. Carriere might have learned
something. Did you ask him?”</p>

<p>“I asked, yes.” Victor cast a hasty glance
at Paulette, who answered by lifting her eyebrows
and compressing her lips, but she said
not a word. “You know that all those towns
beyond there were occupied by the Germans,
all that country, in fact.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know that, but it is not so now, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
if he had been there he could have left when the
Germans retreated.”</p>

<p>“To be sure.” Victor looked down helplessly,
picked up Pom Pom, put him down, got
up and walked to the window, where he stood
without saying anything.</p>

<p>“Well?” said Lucie at last. “Why don’t
you go on, Victor?” she added in a panic.
“What is it? What have you heard?”</p>

<p>“You know they shelled those towns,” said
Victor at last, his back still turned.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I know. Poor grandfather, he
was hurt! I see. Tell me, tell me. He lies
somewhere wounded, suffering.”</p>

<p>Victor turned around, came close and took
her two hands in his. “He is not suffering now,
little Lucie,” he said gently.</p>

<p>Lucie looked at him wildly for a moment,
then she understood. She buried her face in
her hands for a moment, then she ran sobbing
to Paulette to hide her face on the good woman’s
shoulder. “He is dead, grandfather is dead!”
she faltered. “Oh, this cruel, cruel war, will
it take everything from us?”</p>

<p>“Courage, little one, courage,” whispered
Paulette, patting her softly. “He was not
young, the dear man. His time had come and
the good God took him.”</p>

<p>“Tell me,” said Lucie, turning her streaming
eyes upon Victor. “Tell me all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>“This Gustave Foucher in whose cart your
grandfather traveled, turned aside, as you
already know, but, poor man, he turned the
wrong way, for soon he found himself in the
midst of bombardment. He could not go on;
he could not go back. The Germans were in
possession, shells were bursting, bombs falling.
In hurrying to shelter your grandfather was
struck by shrapnel. He lived on a few minutes.
A quick death and an easy one.”</p>

<p>“And how did you learn this, Mons. Victor?”
asked Paulette.</p>

<p>“I inquired in every town through which I
passed, and at last I was told by those remaining
in the town. They remembered Foucher
quite well, and the old man who came with
him and who was killed.”</p>

<p>“And Gustave?”</p>

<p>“Was sent into Germany by the Boches.”</p>

<p>Lucie, who had recovered from her first violent
fit of crying, said quietly, “I would rather my
grandfather should die than be sent into Germany.”</p>

<p>“One is not necessarily ill treated,” said Victor.
“He would be made to work, and he would not
feast on the fat of the land, to be sure.”</p>

<p>“And I suppose those Boches had the benefit
of our basket of food that was in the cart,”
said Paulette, turning to Lucie.</p>

<p>Sad as the occasion was, Victor could not withstand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
smiling, and even into Lucie’s eyes crept
a less mournful look. It was so like Paulette
to regret the food.</p>

<p>“I suppose you have seen nothing of my
Jean,” said Paulette, changing the subject.</p>

<p>Victor shook his head. “Do you hear from
him?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Not often. Once or twice. He was safe
two weeks ago. He is a good boy, that Jean,
and when he gets his <i>permissionaire</i> he will
come to see me, though I wish he might find
me elsewhere than in Paris.”</p>

<p>“Then you do not like this fine city.”</p>

<p>Paulette flung out her hands contemptuously.
“It is a den of confusion, not so bad now, perhaps
since there are fewer vehicles, but I do not
find myself at home, and I would rather work
in the fields than in a vile laundry.”</p>

<p>“Is that what you are doing?” Victor asked
in surprise.</p>

<p>“One must do what one can. I do not care
to beg nor to live upon charity. It is necessary
to have clothing as well as food. This moment
that child needs shoes, or will soon.”</p>

<p>“Does your father know of this?” Victor
asked Lucie.</p>

<p>“My father? We have not had a word from
him. In some way Paulette was able to find
out that he had been sent to a convalescent
hospital in the south. We hope my mother<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
is with him, but we do not know. There
seems no way to find out. We do not know
where to inquire about such things.”</p>

<p>“This must be attended to,” exclaimed Victor.
“It cannot be allowed to go on. I will
see to this myself. If your father by this time
has not returned to his duties, at least he is
well enough to know what is happening to you.”</p>

<p>“We did not want to worry him while he was
so ill,” explained Lucie, “and after that we did
not know where to address him.”</p>

<p>“You could have found out.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>Victor shrugged his shoulders in despair.
The helplessness of the girl, the ignorance of
the peasant woman, who was also proud and
suspicious, was really pitiful. Of Lucie’s father
he felt sure he could get a report. Of her
mother he had grave doubts which he did not
mention. “We shall soon get this straightened
out,” he said confidently. “It is the first
matter I shall attend to. You have not noticed
that I have a promotion, Lucie, and I am much
aggrieved. Do you not perceive that I am now a
corporal?”</p>

<p>“Really? How stupid of me not to notice,
but these other things—” she stopped to draw a
long sigh. “I congratulate you, Victor. How
did you win your stripe?”</p>

<p>“Oh, never mind; it was a little matter not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
worth the talking about. I only drew attention
to it that you might properly respect me.
To-morrow being Sunday I thought we might
celebrate it by a little dinner. I believe they
still dine in Paris. It is fine weather. We
will make a holiday and take a walk in the
gardens and have a little treat. What do you
say, Paulette? You will go?”</p>

<p>Paulette, pleased to be included, smiled a
gracious acceptance, at the same time knowing
perfectly well that Lucie could not be allowed
to go without her, and believing it would be a
good thing to divert the child at this particular
time.</p>

<p>“And Annette, you hear from Annette?
That is another person who does not answer
my letters,” said Lucie.</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, Annette, of course. She is safe,
out of the danger zone, but not in the place she
expected to be, for that ceased to be safe, and
with her grandparents she has gone farther off.”</p>

<p>“So, of course that is why I have not heard
from her.”</p>

<p>“I will give you her address; that much at
least I can do, and I promise I will soon have
news of your father.”</p>

<p>“You are very comforting, Victor; you
always are, even this time when you bring me
such sorrowful tidings, you comfort me, too.
It is very hard for us to have no one.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>“There is no use in complaining,” said Paulette
stoically. “We have done very well,
Mons. Victor. We have not starved and we
have kept a roof over our heads, which is more
than some can say. I will light you down. One
must not illuminate these days.”</p>

<p>“Good night, little Lucie, and keep up your
courage,” said Victor. “To-morrow we shall
make a holiday, a quiet one, but still a holiday.”</p>

<p>After watching soldier and faithful servant
grope their way down one dim flight, by the
flickering light of a candle, Lucie returned to
her room. At the foot of the stairs Paulette
paused. “It is not for the father I fear so much
as the mother,” she said. “If she has been sent
to Germany, who knows? who knows?”</p>

<p>“That is in my mind, also, Paulette,” said
Victor. “We must not let the child know our
fears. She is too young to suffer more than she
must, and that is enough. It goes to my
heart to see her here in Paris when I remember
how gay and happy she was in that other place.”</p>

<p>“It is the will of the <i>bon Dieu</i>, and we must
be patient. It is wonderful, monsieur, how
patient she has been, and how eager she is to
help. If you will believe it she can cook a
meal as well as any woman. Even I say it,
and the <i>potage</i> she can make need not be despised
by any one. She has grown in more
ways than in inches.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>“I have done that myself, Paulette,” said
Victor gravely. “I shall never again be the
careless lad I used to be before this war.”</p>

<p>“It will be so with my Jean, I suppose, if
so be God spares him,” said Paulette solemnly.</p>

<p>“And if not he will have a glorious record,
that which belongs to one who dies for his
country,” returned Victor. “You will try to
comfort the little one, Paulette. Do not let
her grieve too much for the grandfather. I
will not say how fine I think you have been in
caring for her. It will be a great consolation
to her mother when she knows.”</p>

<p>“There is nothing to say, monsieur,” returned
Paulette with dignity. “I am doing my duty
which is also my pleasure, for I love the child.
I have watched her and served her since she
came into the world; it would be a fine thing
if I deserted her now.”</p>

<p>She opened the door and let him out into the
dark and silent street, then slowly climbed the
four flights of stairs to the garret room where
Lucie sat in the darkness.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br>

<small>NENETTE AND RINTINTIN</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was when they came from church that
Lucie and Paulette found Victor waiting
for them, “Come, come,” he said, “we must
begin our day at once.”</p>

<p>“We shall have to go up to get Pom Pom
first,” returned Lucie. “He has been shut up
too long a time to please him as it is. It will
be a happy time for him, for he has none too
much chance for being out-of-doors.”</p>

<p>“He knew me at once and was glad to see me,
the little rascal,” said Victor.</p>

<p>“He will always love you best, though I do
think he loves me very well,” said Lucie.</p>

<p>“I should have credited him with better
sense,” responded Victor.</p>

<p>“Because of his loving me very well?” asked
Lucie mischievously.</p>

<p>“Not at all, but because you think he loves
me more. However, I do not admit that.”</p>

<p>Lucie laughed teasingly. She had lain awake
a long time the night before, full of trouble and
forebodings. She mourned her grandfather sincerely,
but she was very young; she had become<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
accustomed to thinking of him as apart
from her daily life, therefore she did not miss
him as she once would have done. Moreover,
the promise of a day of pleasure could but cheer
her up, as Victor intended it should do.</p>

<p>She ran upstairs, and presently Pom Pom
came dashing down in a perfect turmoil of
excitement, the more violent when he beheld
Victor. “If I were something smaller he would
eat me up,” declared Victor, trying to evade
Pom Pom’s lavish bestowal of kisses. “Do
you then take me for a lump of meat, Pom
Pom?”</p>

<p>At last the dog’s ecstasies were diminished and
Victor gave himself up to planning for the day’s
outing. “What do you say to a little trip on
the river? We may not find it possible to go
very far, but a little way is not out of the question.
I have a comrade who lives at Auteuil.
I have promised to take word of him to his
people. Would this plan be agreeable to you,
Lucie, and you, Paulette?”</p>

<p>“I should adore it,” declared Lucie. “Isn’t
it a delightful idea, Paulette?”</p>

<p>In her heart of hearts Paulette was not so
sure. She had never in all her life had the
experience of a trip on the water, but if Lucie
wanted it, be it far from her to object, so she
said in the most indifferent way: “It is all one to
me. Suit yourselves and I shall be suited.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>Down to the river they went to board one of
the small steamers plying none too frequently
between Charenton and Auteuil. On the way
Victor stopped to buy a newspaper and some
sweet chocolate, which latter he might not have
been able to get but for the fact that he was a
<i>poilu</i> to whom nothing was to be denied. He
handed it to Lucie, who accepted as gratefully
as any girl would who had not tasted chocolate
in any form for months. Paulette seated herself
gingerly. She was armed with the green
umbrella, explaining that no one knew when it
might rain. She balanced herself on the seat
as if momentarily one might expect to be
tipped over in one direction or the other, but
she soon became accustomed to the easy motion
of the steamboat and entertained herself by
looking at the other passengers. There was
quite a number of soldiers with their sweethearts,
a few country people, a couple of nuns, a
priest or two.</p>

<p>“At Auteuil we shall take our first meal,”
announced Victor.</p>

<p>“I suppose you know where to go,” returned
Paulette.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” he answered serenely. “I know;
it is one reason why we go. These parents of
my comrade, it is they who keep a small inn.
I tell myself that it is a good policy to go there
for we shall be well treated without doubt.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>“Ah-h,” breathed Paulette with satisfaction.
“That was a clever idea, monsieur.”</p>

<p>“So I told myself. I said I will go there first
because Honoré wishes me to; second, because
we shall probably fare better there than anywhere
else.”</p>

<p>“Ah-h,” breathed Paulette again. “It is
well that those two reasons fitted so conveniently,
monsieur.”</p>

<p>Victor laughed, opened his newspaper and
began reading bits of news to Lucie. Pom
Pom lay on the seat between them, gazing with
fascinated eyes at these new scenes through
which he was passing.</p>

<p>At last came their landing place, and they went
ashore. Victor led the way through this and
that street till they stopped before a small inn
set in a garden. It bore a sign which set forth
the fact that this was the restaurant Honoré,
kept by one Pierre Blondot. Victor went in,
the others following. A gray-haired man came
forward. “Do I address the father of my comrade
Honoré Blondot?” said Victor in his best
manner.</p>

<p>“<i>Mon Dieu!</i>” cried the man, “you are the
friend of our boy? He is well? You bear no
bad news?”</p>

<p>“He is very well, and I promised to come and
tell you this with my own lips. In passing I
will say also that I have brought these ladies to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
have breakfast in your so charming establishment,
of whose merits I have heard many times
from my friend Honoré.”</p>

<p>“<i>Bien, bien!</i> That is very well, as it should
be. I welcome you and your friends. Marie,
Marie, come at once. Here is a pleasant surprise
for us. It is my wife that I call, my
friends. It is the mother of Honoré who is
coming.”</p>

<p>A stout, trim, little dumpling of a woman
came bustling forward. “What is this? What
is this, Pierre?”</p>

<p>Swelling with importance the good host with
a wave of the hands included the guests. “This
monsieur, Marie, what think you? he arrives
on his <i>permissionaire</i>, is it not so, monsieur?
He comes direct to us with a message from our
son, his comrade. Is this not a fine thing, that
he comes to us?”</p>

<p>“Oh, monsieur, you have seen him, you know
him? The little one, he remembered to send us
a message. He is well? He is not unhappy?”</p>

<p>“He is very well, madame, and he is quite
content. We are all content after the victory.
Paris is saved.”</p>

<p>“I will so embrace you, monsieur, for it is
you with the others who have done this great
thing,” said mine host tearfully, as he laid his
big hands on Victor’s shoulders and kissed him on
each cheek. “I give you my thanks, my child.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>“Ah, but monsieur, madame, I have done
nothing. I am but a very small atom,” protested
Victor.</p>

<p>“Without the atoms there could not be a
thing entire,” said their host. “But, Marie,
we are forgetting the ladies. A thousand
pardons, mademoiselle, madame. I beg you
will come in and be seated. Breakfast, Marie,
and the best, the best.”</p>

<p>At these words Victor turned to give Paulette
a sly wink, while she, quite embarrassed at
being one of the party at table, and wondering
if she would be spared committing a lapse in
table manners, seated herself in the place indicated
by Pierre.</p>

<p>There were no other guests and the whole
establishment seemed to be run by the goodman
and his wife, a fact which Lucie noted and
whispered to Paulette.</p>

<p>“So much the better,” she returned; “the
meal will probably be better cooked and better
served,” as indeed it was.</p>

<p>After days of frugality it was indeed a treat
to partake of a tasty soup, omelette of the
freshest of eggs, chicken of the tenderest,
grapes and pears just gathered. “I regret
that the coffee is not up to the mark,” complained
Pierre, who himself waited on them,
“but what can you expect? <i>C’est la guerre.</i>”</p>

<p>Madame came from the kitchen rather flushed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
and embarrassed to ask timidly if Victor could
find place in his luggage for a small package
which she wished to send to her son. “It is
but one pair of socks and another little thing,”
she explained.</p>

<p>“I can find room for a dozen pairs of socks,”
he responded heartily, “and would be glad to
carry that many.”</p>

<p>“But no, monsieur, that would not be possible,”
returned Madame. “One pair is all I
have ready,” at which innocent reply Victor
laughed heartily, rather to the discomfiture of
the good little woman, who did not see the
humor of it, and to turn the subject said to
Lucie: “Perhaps mademoiselle would like to
see a small thing I am sending. If monsieur
can wait till I have put up the parcel.”</p>

<p>Victor assured her that time was no object
just then. He would walk in the garden,
smoke a cigarette, exchange views with Monsieur
Pierre who perhaps would like to ask
intimate questions about his son. Madame
beckoned to Lucie who went off with her to an
inner room. From a drawer Madame drew
forth the socks and a little box which she
opened and handed to Lucie to examine.</p>

<p>“And what are these?” asked Lucie as she
held up two queer little figures, two or three
inches long.</p>

<p>Madame smiled. “Those,” she said, “are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
Nenette and Rintintin. I am sending them to
my son.”</p>

<p>Lucie regarded them with a puzzled expression.
“But why—are they, does one make
any use of them?”</p>

<p>Madame smiled. “You do not know? I
must then tell you that Nenette and Rintintin
bring good luck. They protect a <i>poilu</i> from the
Zeppelins, from the aircraft guns and all that.
One must not ask for them. They must be
bestowed voluntarily. They must not be
bought. A friend must make them. They
are little creatures of good luck.”</p>

<p>“How delightful! I wish I could make a
pair for Victor.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“I could not without a pattern. With one
to imitate I think I could, and if not my
friend Odette, who is so clever, could help
me.”</p>

<p>Madame considered the situation for a moment.
She sincerely wished to aid Lucie in
her project. A happy thought came to her.
“When does monsieur return?”</p>

<p>“To-morrow night.”</p>

<p>“Then, mademoiselle, I will tell you what we
will do: You will take charge of the package.
We will tell monsieur that you keep it safe for
him and you can then make your little figures,
to-morrow, we will say, return them to the parcel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
here, and give it to monsieur before he leaves.
I am sure you will not forget to put them in
with the socks and the so short note I am about
to write.”</p>

<p>“Oh, madame, how very kind!” cried Lucie.
“I will take the utmost care, I assure you, and
will not fail to do up the parcel neatly and give
it to Victor, though”—She paused suddenly
and a look of disappointment came over her
face as she stood looking down at the little
figures she held.</p>

<p>“What is it, <i>chérie</i>?” asked Madame solicitously.</p>

<p>“It is this, madame. I am afraid after all
that I shall not be able to make them, for you
see we are refugees who have scarcely more
than we now wear. Where then would I get
materials?”</p>

<p>“<i>Pauvre petite</i>, if that is all it is a matter soon
mended. It takes so very little, you see, and
if you will allow me I shall be glad to furnish
what you may need. Should I not be permitted
to do this much for a comrade of my
Honoré? It is a very small matter indeed.”</p>

<p>This delicate way of putting it quite eased
Lucie’s mind, so she accepted the offer as simply
as possible and returned to find Paulette taking
a comfortable nap in a corner and Victor out
in the garden with Monsieur Pierre.</p>

<p>Victor settled the bill and the guests parted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
from their hosts with many polite phrases on
both sides. It was not within the limits of
Paulette’s curiosity to refrain from asking if
it were not very expensive, this meal, and they
were barely out of hearing when she put the
question.</p>

<p>“But no,” Victor assured her. “If I were
to tell you the price you would at once establish
yourself permanently at the restaurant Honoré.
It was in vain that I protested at the small
price. Monsieur Pierre insisted that it was his
regular charge for a breakfast and nothing would
induce him to take a sou more. Did I think
he would cheat a friend and that friend his son’s
comrade? Therefore you see there was nothing
left to say.”</p>

<p>“It may be his regular price,” commented
Paulette shrewdly, “but I venture to say that
he has never before given this same menu.”</p>

<p>“Now then,” said Victor, “we have done our
duty by my friend Honoré as well as to our own
appetites, there is then the next thing. Shall
we go back as we came, or shall we take the
Metro after having had a walk in the Bois
which shall make us the more ready for our
dinner in the city when the time comes?”</p>

<p>“Another meal, Victor?” exclaimed Lucie.</p>

<p>“Why not? Doesn’t one dine on Sundays?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but not when one has had such a feast.”</p>

<p>“That is not the point. The point is that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
when I am here on leave I intend to eat all I
can, see all I can, enjoy myself to the limit of
my opportunities.”</p>

<p>Paulette lifted her eyebrows and gave her
expressive shrug of the shoulders. “Your
opportunities must be very few, monsieur, if
the height of your enjoyment is in the society
of an old peasant woman and a little girl.”</p>

<p>“Would you have me spend all my time in
making new acquaintances? Is anything better
than old friends? But you have not told me,
Lucie, which you prefer, the walk through the
Bois or the return trip on the river.”</p>

<p>Lucie looked down dubiously at her shoes now
much the worse for wear. “If my shoes will
stand it I should prefer the walk, but the soles
have become very thin. You see the pair I
had on when I left home gave out before we
reached Paris, and these are now the only ones
I have.”</p>

<p>“We will try to avoid the damp places, and
if we come to any path too wet I can carry you
over.”</p>

<p>“Monsieur!” exclaimed Paulette, quite scandalized.</p>

<p>“It would be quite easy for me, I can assure
you,” responded Victor imperturbably. “After
the load a soldier must become accustomed to,
the burden of carrying Mademoiselle Lucie
would be nothing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>“<i>Coquin!</i>” cried Paulette, shaking her finger
at him. “If any one must lift mademoiselle
it will be I.”</p>

<p>“Then we must try to avoid the wet places,”
returned Victor.</p>

<p>They turned into a street which led them to
the Bois de Boulogne. Victor had provided
himself with a little map which he consulted
from time to time, but in spite of it they did
wander a little from their route and actually
did happen upon a moist by-path before which
there was a discussion.</p>

<p>Victor stooped down to examine it. “There
is only one little place where it is very wet,”
he said, “and I can carry you over that, Lucie.”</p>

<p>“You will do nothing of the kind,” declared
Paulette, bristling up. “If mademoiselle cannot
walk without getting her feet wet I will
carry her.”</p>

<p>“And a pretty spectacle it would be,” protested
Victor, “if any one were to come along, to
behold a soldier permitting a woman to do such
a thing. Are we men permitted to show no
chivalry?”</p>

<p>“Zut!” exclaimed Paulette, snapping her
fingers. “That for your chivalry; it is all
because you wish to have your own way.”</p>

<p>“La! La!” cried Lucie, “are you two
going to spoil the day by quarreling over me?
No one shall carry me. I shall walk.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>“And get your feet wet,” grumbled Paulette.</p>

<p>“A happy thought!” cried Victor, whipping
out his newspaper. “We will arrange this.
Step upon the paper, Lucie.” He spread the
doubled paper upon the spot, Lucie put out
her little slim foot, stepped lightly and was over
without further ado. Victor picked up the
paper, looked at the footprint for a second,
then with a chuckle, folded the paper, put it
back in his pocket and followed on.</p>

<p>Pom Pom, always in the lead, enjoyed his
day quite as much as the rest, at least he had
not the somber thoughts which haunted Lucie
during every silence. To be sure these silences
were not many, for the young people chatted
constantly while Pom Pom explored, dashed
on ahead, lay down to rest till the others came
up, and was quite as tired a member of the
party as any when at last they stopped at a
modest restaurant on a side street.</p>

<p>“Another home of a comrade, Victor?”
asked Lucie smiling.</p>

<p>“No, although the place was recommended
by one. We shall not fare so well as we did
this morning, I fancy, but I have the password
which will probably serve to bring out such
food as they have, and it will be well cooked,
though simple. Are you tired, Lucie, and are
those shoes entirely worn out?”</p>

<p>Lucie looked down at her right foot. “This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
one is the worst,” she said; “the other will last,
but it is unfortunate that one must have two
shoes.”</p>

<p>“That is one of those unpleasant truths we
must face in this world,” returned Victor,
laughing. “You should be hungry after your
long walk.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I have walked farther,” returned
Lucie, a shadow crossing her face.</p>

<p>“But that is past,” said Victor cheerfully.</p>

<p>Lucie made no reply, but gave her attention
to the soup which was now served them, and
the meal went on. It was not quite so lively
as that of the morning, for in the first place it
was not so appetizing, and they were all tired
in the second place. Then, too, to-morrow
would be a working day, to which Paulette at
least looked forward with no pleasure. It
promised, however, a pleasanter prospect to
Lucie who anticipated the agreeable task of
fashioning a Nenette and Rintintin for Victor.
She looked down at the little parcel which she
had placed on the table beside her.</p>

<p>“You’d better give that to me now,” said
Victor.</p>

<p>Lucie shook her head. “No, I promised
Madame I would take charge of it till you were
ready with your farewells.”</p>

<p>“She seems to have very little confidence in
me,” remarked Victor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>“It might be for that reason or it might be
for some other,” returned Lucie mysteriously.</p>

<p>“Are you inviting me to guess?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps—but no, I do not wish you to. If
there is another reason I will tell you when you
come to go.”</p>

<p>“More and more mysterious. Very well,
you must not forget to tell me.”</p>

<p>Lucie knew that this was not likely. She
held fast to the little parcel all the way home,
and could scarcely wait to show the tiny figures
to Odette after Victor had left. “You will
help me, Odette?”</p>

<p>“To be sure, and perhaps I can make a pair,
too. There might be a soldier to whom I
could give them,” Odette returned. “To be
sure I know of no one now, but he might come
my way, and it is just as well to be prepared.”
She laughed gleefully.</p>

<p>Lucie was very impatient till the morning’s
work was out of the way, Paulette off for the
day, and Odette ready to sit down with her. “It
is like playing with dolls again, isn’t it?” she
said.</p>

<p>“But it is much more to the purpose,”
declared Odette, sorting out the materials.</p>

<p>“There appears to be quite enough for two
sets,” said Lucie, “so we can divide, which
will be very nice. You can have half to pay
for helping me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>“But you might want another pair, for your
father, for instance.”</p>

<p>Lucie had not thought of this, and was not
quite sure whether her father would be frivolous
enough to appreciate the attention. She considered
the matter while Odette busied herself
in selecting what was needed for Nenette and
what for Rintintin. After a moment she looked
up, bunching the stuffs in her nimble little
fingers. “These will be more than enough,”
she decided. “I think with economy one could
get out another couple.”</p>

<p>“That would be fine,” cried Lucie, “so let us
begin. How should one do it?”</p>

<p>Odette deftly started to pucker the stuff into
shape, and before long Nenette was called into
existence, then Rintintin was soon in condition
to be given his name.</p>

<p>“Aren’t they precious?” exclaimed Lucie,
dangling them before her. “I shall really get
too fond of them and shall want to keep them.
It is just as well that Victor is going to-night
or I might be tempted.”</p>

<p>“We will make the others and can keep at
least one couple.”</p>

<p>“Until your soldier appears and then they
must be given up. I shall send mine to papa
at once. We must show them to Paulette.
Shall you let your aunt see yours?”</p>

<p>“She would not be interested.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>Lucie hesitated before she asked a question
which was on the end of her tongue, but at
last she did say: “This aunt, Odette, is she
kind to you?”</p>

<p>“She does not beat me,” replied Odette with
a little wry smile, “and I am grateful to her for
letting me stay with her when I was left with
no one. I think that perhaps she is sorry
that she allowed me, for it is very hard to find
food for all. The ladies pay me for knitting
the socks, but there is not any too much of
that work to do, and I wish I might go back
to the country. I am strong enough to work
in the fields and it would be better than this.”</p>

<p>“That is what Paulette says. I wish, myself,
that we were all there. Look at this second
Rintintin, Odette. Isn’t he a droll fellow; I
think I like him better than the first.”</p>

<p>In due course of time the freakish little
figures were finished. Odette carried hers away.
Lucie danced hers before the eyes of Pom Pom
who tried to snap them up, then they were put
away till Paulette should return and the business
of dinner should be over.</p>

<p>“Aren’t they funny, Paulette?” asked Lucie
as she displayed the fantastic little creatures.
“This is what Odette and I have been doing to-day,
making these.”</p>

<p>“Have you then gone back to playing with
dolls?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>“Oh, no, no. You don’t understand. These
are Nenette and Rintintin. Madame Blondot
told me of them yesterday and gave me the
material for making them. She has sent a
pair to her son. One makes them, you see, to
give to a <i>poilu</i> for good luck. They carry good
fortune, Madame said, protect from danger.
They must be given voluntarily. The soldier
does not ask for them or that takes away the
charm. So then, these are for Victor and these
for papa.”</p>

<p>Paulette examined them with interest. She
was as full of superstitions as most peasant
folk. “One never can tell,” she remarked, “a
little thing that seems ridiculous, a horseshoe,
for instance, brings good luck. It is worth
while not to pass by anything. I have no
capacity for making such things; if I had—”</p>

<p>She paused but Lucie understood that she
wished that her boy might have two of the
farcical little mascots. He shall have, Lucie
told herself, remembering those Odette was
keeping for some soldier. Why not Jean?</p>

<p>Then came Victor to make his adieux and
to get the little parcel to take to Honoré. “It
seems much smaller than it did,” he said as
Lucie handed it to him.</p>

<p>She laughed. “And yet I have not abstracted
the socks. Here also, Victor, is something for
you; Nenette and Rintintin.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>“Ah-h!” Victor took them with a pleased
look. “You made them for me?”</p>

<p>“I made them, though Odette helped; she
is so clever, you know. They bear a charm,
as perhaps you have heard. They will keep
danger from you.”</p>

<p>“They will do something else; they will
remind me of my little friend, Lucie, who has
taken the trouble to make them for me.” He
fastened them to his coat. “I made inquiries
about your father to-day and learn that he has
been removed to another place, a chateau, where
he, with other convalescents, will remain till they
can return to their regiments. I have written
to him, and have asked him to communicate with
you as soon as possible. Here is his address.”</p>

<p>“I am glad, so glad. A thousand thanks,
dear Victor, for doing this. But my mother,
my mother?”</p>

<p>Victor shook his head sadly. “I am sorry,
but there is no news there. But cheer up, dear
little Lucie, do not look so mournful. Any day
you may have news of her. In this war surprises
are what one must expect. You will
write to me and tell me how you prosper?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, and you?”</p>

<p>“Will do the same. I shall cherish Nenette
and Rintintin as if they were my own children.
I came only to say good-by, for I must soon be
getting off.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>“It is sad that you must go.”</p>

<p>“But has it not been a wonderful holiday?
When I get another we will celebrate again.
Adieu! Adieu! et <i>bon chance</i>!”</p>

<p>“<i>Bon chance! Bon chance!</i> Victor. Adieu!
Adieu!” from Lucie.</p>

<p>“Adieu, monsieur. <i>Que Dieu vous soit en
aide</i>,” from Paulette. And Victor was clattering
down the stairs and out into the dim streets.</p>

<p>But the small shadow that followed him a
trifle in the rear was not cast by the bobbing
forms of Nenette and Rintintin.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br>

<small>A DOG AND HIS DAY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was in the middle of the night that Lucie
woke with a consciousness of something
missing. The little furry ball always curled up
at her feet was not there. She sat up in bed.
“Pom Pom” she called softly, feeling along the
edge of her cot and reaching over toward the
foot. But no moist little tongue licked her hand
in response. “He has gone to Paulette,” decided
Lucie, for once in a great while he took a
notion to cuddle down by the older woman.
Having made up her mind that this was the way
of it Lucie snuggled down again and it was not
till morning that she discovered that Pom Pom
was really gone.</p>

<p>“He was here last night when Victor came,”
said the girl distressedly. “You remember,
Paulette, how he jumped on Victor and barked
so sharply that to stop him Victor took him in
his lap.”</p>

<p>“He may have followed him downstairs and
have been shut in—or out,” Paulette suggested.</p>

<p>“Then he would be back by now scratching
at the door. He has lingered once or twice down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
there but always he has come back in a hurry; he
would do it now.”</p>

<p>“Unless some one picked him up.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Paulette, what a dreadful thought!”
Lucie clasped her hands agitatedly. “I will go
down at once to see if Mathilde knows anything
about him.” This was no sooner said than
done. Downstairs flew Lucie to find and
question Mathilde.</p>

<p>“But no, mademoiselle,” said Mathilde. “The
little dog? Yes, yes, I know him well. I have
not seen him, nor have I heard him. If he had
come to the door I would have let him in, for I
would have understood, I, that one does not like
to lose a pet. There is sorrow enough that cannot
be avoided in these days without adding
anxiety over a loss of that kind.”</p>

<p>“If you should see him, madame. If you will
inquire of those in the neighborhood when you
have a chance. Some one may have picked him
up without knowing where he belongs.”</p>

<p>“If I find him I will send him up to you flying.
Rest assured of that.”</p>

<p>This was the best that could be done and Lucie
returned very miserable. “Is it not true that
troubles never come singly?” she said. “Victor
brings me sad news of my grandfather and now
comes the loss of my darling Pom Pom.”</p>

<p>“But Monsieur Victor also brought you good
news of your father. Do not despair so soon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
little one. The day is but begun; you may have
him safe before I get home. Have you inquired
of Odette?”</p>

<p>“No, for it seemed no use.”</p>

<p>“It will do no harm, for he may have scratched
at our door and we may not have heard him. I
sleep heavily these days, and then he may have
gone to Odette as the next friend to rely upon.
I go now, <i>chérie</i>. Do not despond.”</p>

<p>She went out and Lucie followed as far as the
next door, upon which she tapped. The doors
now were not locked since the two little girls had
become intimates and wished to run back and
forth at will. Hearing no response to her rap
Lucie went in. Odette was sitting, elbows on
window sill, staring out into the street. It was
a gray day, somber and chill, for winter was at
hand. “Have you seen Pom Pom?” Lucie
made her query without further delay.</p>

<p>“Pom Pom? No, why, have you lost him?”</p>

<p>Lucie dropped down on the floor and covered
her face with her hands. “He is gone, gone,
the dear little dog whom I loved so well, and,
whom I promised to take good care of.”</p>

<p>“When did you see him last?”</p>

<p>“When Victor was here last evening. He was
so overjoyed when Victor arrived. You never
saw such delight. Paulette thinks he may have
followed Victor downstairs, but of course Victor
would have sent him back.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>“If he saw him. This is what I think; that he
followed your friend to the street. Monsieur
sent him back. He returned to find the door
shut.”</p>

<p>“He would have waited there till morning
unless some one picked him up. Oh, Odette, I
have lost him, lost him, and now I no more have
a dear little dog to love me and to love.”</p>

<p>“But you have others; me, I have no one,
not even a dog to love or to love me.”</p>

<p>Lucie looked up through her tears. “But
Odette, I love you.”</p>

<p>Odette smiled rather sadly. “Not as you do
Pom Pom. You would not weep if you were to
lose me out of your days. Don’t cry, Lucie. Let
us go out and look for him. This is such an
unusual occasion that I think we need not ask
permission. We will need to go only around
the neighborhood.”</p>

<p>It was a comfort to Lucie that she could make
some active effort toward looking for the little
dog, but though they went from dairy to bakery,
from bakery to butcher shop, and so on the
rounds no one had seen or heard anything of the
lost Pom Pom. So they returned quite hopeless
and discouraged, and Lucie spent a melancholy
day.</p>

<p>Odette tried to comfort her as best she could,
succeeding in making her laugh more than once,
though immediately she would lapse into a fit of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
weeping. “I shouldn’t care so much if I could
know he would be well cared for,” she mourned.
“A little dumb beast is so helpless; he cannot tell
his troubles if he is neglected and ill treated. He
has never known anything but kindness.”</p>

<p>“Then he is better off than many human
beings,” returned Odette somberly.</p>

<p>Lucie looked at her through her tears.
“Odette, are you ill treated?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I suppose one should not mind harsh words,
and should not call oneself ill treated who has
nothing more than that, but, you see, even your
dog wanted affection, and you are mourning
because you think he has none, or, perhaps,
has none, while I—there is not a soul on
earth to give me a word of love, much less a
caress.”</p>

<p>Lucie moved close up to her and put her arms
tightly around her. “My little Odette,” she
whispered, “my dear Odette whom I love. I
shall miss my dear dog, but I am thankful that
I have you, my friend.”</p>

<p>“Lucie, Lucie,” murmured Odette, “you do
not know how I love you, how I have longed to
have you love me. I am only a little peasant
girl, but I can be faithful and true. Do you
know that many times when I have seen you
fondling your dog I have wished that I, too, were
a dog, for then some one might be as good to me
as you were to Pom Pom.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>“That seems very sad,” returned Lucie, “but
it is better to be a friend than a dog, and that
you are and always will be. Do you know what
I think, Odette? I think when this war is over
that it would be a fine thing for you to go back
with us to our town. We must see about that.
I shall talk of it to Paulette who already likes
you so much. She is not one to take fancies,
but she has said to me: ‘She is a bright one, that
Odette. With a little training and experience
she will do well,’ and that is a great deal for
Paulette to say, for she is very chary of her
praise.”</p>

<p>“This may be a sad day for you, Lucie, but it
is a very happy one for me, or would be if you
were not so miserable.”</p>

<p>“I shall try not to be miserable, for who knows
what may happen before the day is out? That
is what my mother used to tell me. So bright
and cheerful, such a sunny nature, mother
had. I think, Odette, that all other sorrow
would seem as nothing if I could see her again.
Even if I knew her to be safe and well, I could
be cheerful.”</p>

<p>“I can understand that,” Odette agreed.
“That day may come, and sooner than you
expect.”</p>

<p>It seemed that Odette was a true prophet, for
that very evening the clouds began to break
away for Lucie. “Well, mademoiselle,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
Paulette when she came in, “who is sending you
presents? Here is a letter too.”</p>

<p>“But alas, no news of Pom Pom,” returned
Lucie.</p>

<p>“I do not yet despair. He may be shut up
somewhere and will come to us fast enough
when he is free.”</p>

<p>This sounded encouraging, so Lucie opened
her letter. “It is from Victor,” she announced,
beginning to read.</p>

<p>“Humph!” exclaimed Paulette. “He loses
no time.”</p>

<p>Lucie paid no attention to this; she was eagerly
reading the page before her. “Paulette, Paulette,”
she cried suddenly, “listen to this. Oh,
that bad Pom Pom!”</p>

<p>Paulette dropped the soup ladle-back into the
kettle. “<i>Mon Dieu!</i>” she cried. “What is this
about Pom Pom?”</p>

<p>“Listen and I will read about that ungrateful
little one. This is what Victor writes: ‘Dear
Lucie: The train is about to start but before it
goes I must tell you that Pom Pom is here and
that I shall have to take him with me as there is
no time to return him to you. The boys will be
happy to receive him as a mascot, and I hope
no harm will come to him. I know you will miss
him, but if we come out of this safely you shall
have him again. <i>Au revoir.</i> Victor. P.S. Nenette
and Rintintin send their respectful greetings.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
That little rascal Pom Pom followed me all the
way, but I did not discover it till too late, for he
kept well behind me. V.’ Did you ever know
a dog so clever? He knew perfectly well
that he should not go with Victor, but it
is as I said on Sunday; he loves Victor best,
for he was his first beloved. That is constancy
for you.”</p>

<p>“There is no friend more faithful than a dog,”
returned Paulette, beginning again to dip out the
soup.</p>

<p>“We shall miss him,” said Lucie sadly, “but
I am sure he felt that he owed his first duty to
his master. I was a second consideration.
Very well, that must be accepted. I am glad to
know that at least he is in good hands. I must
tell Odette.”</p>

<p>“Take your soup first.”</p>

<p>“It is very hot and I will not stay a minute.”</p>

<p>“I know the minutes of maidens,” grumbled
Paulette.</p>

<p>But Lucie was not to be deterred, and went
off, her minute truly lengthening to five. Paulette,
however, in spite of her grumbling, poured
her bowl of soup back into the pot where it kept
hot for her.</p>

<p>“I should like to open the parcel,” said Lucie
between spoonfuls of soup. “I haven’t the least
idea what it is, have you, Paulette?”</p>

<p>“Not I.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>“But who could have sent it? What is it
like? Did you feel it?”</p>

<p>Paulette smiled. “Such curiosity. It feels
like a box, or, no, like something hard. One does
not get many boxes these days. <i>C’est la guerre.</i>”</p>

<p>“Are you sure it is for me?”</p>

<p>“There is the name, the street, the number,
even the floor. Madame Mathilde gave it to
me with the letter as I came in.”</p>

<p>“If I were not so hungry I would open it
directly. Do you think this a pretty good soup,
Paulette?”</p>

<p>“Not so bad.”</p>

<p>“Will not mamma be surprised when she learns
how I can cook a meal all by myself?”</p>

<p>Paulette was silent.</p>

<p>“Oh, I know what you are thinking;
you do not believe that we shall see mamma
again.”</p>

<p>“I said nothing.”</p>

<p>“No, but I know that look which means so
much. I was very doubtful myself before this
news of Pom Pom. I have been so unhappy all
day, Paulette, and but for Odette I think I should
have died. What should I do without Odette
when I have no more a Pom Pom?”</p>

<p>“It is a great satisfaction to me that you have
some one to keep you company while I must be
away.”</p>

<p>“And some one of whom you approve, for you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
do approve of her, don’t you? Of course she is
not of Annette’s class, but she is a dear, fine girl
and I shall love her always and keep her as my
friend. When mamma knows her she will not
object, I am sure.”</p>

<p>“You are speaking very often of your mamma
this evening.”</p>

<p>“Yes, because something tells me that I shall
see her again. That report of papa which Victor
gave us has somehow given me a feeling of being
nearer to my parents. For a time I felt as if I
had none. Now I feel that I have.”</p>

<p>“Heaven grant that it may be so,” responded
Paulette piously as she rose from the frugal meal
and began to clear the table.</p>

<p>It was a scantily furnished, poor little place,
two rooms and a queer sort of kitchenette contrived
from a dark closet where a sink and running
water were established, together with a tiny
stove. It was already a problem how they were
to be kept warm in winter. The larger of the two
rooms held Paulette’s cot, three chairs, a table,
and a set of shelves which served as cupboard.
In Lucie’s room was her cot with one chair and
an iron washstand over which hung a small
mirror. The floors were uncovered and the
only household utensils were those which had
been brought from the old home in that basket
which was retained instead of the one containing
food. More than once Paulette and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
her charge had congratulated themselves that
it was this instead of the other basket.</p>

<p>“The food would have been eaten long ago,”
Paulette declared, “but look what remains.”</p>

<p>The matter of clearing away did not occupy
many minutes and then Lucie opened her
package. It was done up firmly, but with not
more paper than barely necessary, so it was almost
at once that Lucie saw the contents.
“Of all things, Paulette,” she cried, “a pair of
shoes! It is you who have done this to play a
joke upon me.”</p>

<p>“You are quite on the wrong track, my dear,”
responded Paulette, picking up one of the shoes
and examining it carefully. “Even supposing
I had the will I could not have afforded shoes like
these. You should try them on.”</p>

<p>This Lucie did not hesitate to do, stretching
out her little foot to be admired. “Do you see,
Paulette? They fit exactly, a trifle wide, perhaps,
but that is a good fault. Now who in
the world could have chosen so exactly but you?
No one else but Odette could possibly know the
size, and poor Odette has no money to spend on a
gift. Come, Paulette, confess that you have
done this to give me a pleasant surprise.”</p>

<p>“But I tell you that I have nothing to do with
it. Shall I then take credit for a thing which
I have not done? No, no, my child, it is some
other and I can guess who. I may be a stupid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
old pig but it does not tax my brains to guess
the giver.”</p>

<p>Lucie put on the other shoe and sat looking
admiringly at her outstretched feet, all the time
at a loss to read a puzzle which the older woman
had so readily solved. She picked up the paper
which had come around the shoes and examined
the address attentively. She shook out the
paper, then she took off the shoes and looked
inside. “I cannot guess,” she said at last.</p>

<p>Paulette laughed a little grimly. “This person
took your measure very correctly, nevertheless.
It was a clever trick. The good heart, the
good heart of him, and the delicacy. Otherwise
one could not accept, no, of course, one could
not. Now there is nothing to say. There is no
proof possible. One can only use guesswork,
but that is easy enough.”</p>

<p>Then suddenly it dawned upon Lucie. “Victor!”
she cried. “Of course I remember now
that he made me step upon the newspaper, and
that the footprint, that very muddy footprint,
was quite distinct. He folded up the paper
and put it back in his pocket. I wondered a
little at his doing that.”</p>

<p>“One can see through a millstone,” responded
Paulette. “Even I have solved deeper riddles.”</p>

<p>Lucie continued to regard the shoes thoughtfully.
“It is as you say, Paulette, under different
circumstances I could not accept them.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
Even now it seems very strange that Victor
Guerin should be giving Lucie Du Bois a pair of
shoes. I think even now I shall have to ask him
outright, and I shall not wear the shoes till I
have his answer.”</p>

<p>Paulette nodded approbation of this proud
speech. “Continue to keep your pride as long
as you can, my child,” she said. “We may have
to accept help but the moment has not come
yet.”</p>

<p>“If it does come,” returned Lucie, “I hope I
may be able to return it in a proper way. I
shall write to Victor at once.”</p>

<p>But before an answer could come to her letter
came direct news from her father which relieved
her mind as well as Paulette’s. “You cannot
imagine, my precious child,” he wrote, “the
great relief which Victor Guerin’s letter brought
me. All this time and not a word from you!
My imagination has pictured a thousand dreadful
things which might have befallen you. That
you are safe and well gives me great joy, and it is
the utmost satisfaction I feel in knowing that you
are with Paulette who will take good care of you,
I am sure. I have made arrangements to have a
certain sum paid you every month, and this I
hope will give you more comfort. I have
nearly recovered my health and expect soon to go
back to my duties.” Then followed definite
directions about the monthly allowance, words of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
endearment, messages to Paulette and a promise
to write often, but the closing words, “Not a line
from your mother,” were discouraging.</p>

<p>Lucie could scarcely wait for Paulette to come
home on the day this letter was received, and
there was great danger that the dinner would
either be spoiled or that there would be no dinner
at all. A dozen times the child ran out to
see if she could catch sight of Paulette toiling up
the stairs. At last appeared the well-worn
shawl, the black handkerchief tied around the
head. “Paulette, Paulette,” cried Lucie, “come
quickly. I have news, good news.”</p>

<p>Paulette quickened her tread and arrived quite
out of breath. “Madame? Your mother?” she
panted.</p>

<p>“No,” Lucie caught her breath quickly,
“but a letter from papa at last. Come in and I
will read it to you. How tired you are, my poor
Paulette, but never mind, you shall hear the news
and that will make you feel better.” She read
the letter, interrupted by many exclamations and
comments and when she had finished she rushed
over to hug the good woman who, brave enough
under misfortune, was wiping her eyes at this
good news.</p>

<p>“Now we need have no fear of the winter,”
said Lucie excitedly. “We shall be able to keep
warm and to have more food. Will it be enough,
this money, to keep us without your working,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
Paulette? I do dislike to see you coming home
so worn out. You walk all the way and it is
not well for you to stay in that heated place and
then come out into the cold.”</p>

<p>“It is better that I walk,” protested Paulette,
“for I am less liable to take cold doing so. As for
my not working, my little child, that is not to be
thought of. Better that we have more comforts
than merely eke out a subsistence. However,
I can look out for something better and who
knows what chance may bring?”</p>

<p>“It seems as if there were no evil without some
good,” remarked Lucie reflectively. “I miss
Pom Pom so very much; this morning it seemed
as if I could not endure it, then came this letter.
Dear little Pom Pom, I do hope he is well and
happy. He will be if it depends upon Victor.”</p>

<p>“This money of which your father speaks.
How does one get it? Read that again.”</p>

<p>Lucie re-read the part relating to the money.
“You see,” she said, “that we have no trouble
about it. Some one will bring it to us, which is
very good. I wonder how soon. I shall have
to open the door to whoever it is, Paulette.”</p>

<p>“I will speak to Mathilde about that. She
will interrogate and if it is a proper person there
can be no objection. She has the face of a fish
and the manner of an ill-tempered goat, but she
is not so bad. The heart is there, though one
must not expect always to find it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>“She was very, very kind and interested about
Pom Pom, and how she laughed when I told her
of his following Victor. ‘When one of them
wants to be a <i>poilu</i> there is no keeping them,’
she said. I think she is very fond of animals,
more than of people.”</p>

<p>“Probably with good reason,” returned Paulette.</p>

<p>“Even though I no longer have Pom Pom I
shall not be lonely to-morrow,” remarked Lucie,
“for I shall write a long letter to my father, and
I shall begin to expect a letter from Victor and
to look for the person with the money. We are
having a good deal of excitement, Paulette.”</p>

<p>Paulette shrugged her shoulders. “Thank
heaven it is not of a different kind.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br>

<small>TERRORS BY NIGHT</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">VICTOR’S letter did not come the next day,
though the person with the money did,
giving Lucie a greater surprise than even the
shoes. She had eaten her slight midday meal,
consisting of a small bowl of soup left from the
dinner of the day before, and a piece of not very
good bread. She was washing the bowl and
picturing to herself the sort of person likely to
be her father’s messenger, a meager little old man
probably, all the young ones had gone to the war,
it seemed; this one would wear spectacles, have
thin gray hair and be a trifle deaf; he would hold
his hand back of his ear and say “<i>Plait-il?</i>”
when she answered his questions; and then came
the knock at the door.</p>

<p>Lucie jumped. The exciting moment had
arrived. She went to open, fully prepared to
see the sort of person her fancy had created, and
was so taken aback that she could hardly reply
to the question: “Is this where Mlle. Lucie Du
Bois lives?” for instead of a snuffy old man there
stood a radiant, well-dressed young woman.</p>

<p>“I am Lucie Du Bois”; the answer came
stammeringly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>“May I come in?” The young lady smiled.</p>

<p>“Oh, surely. I beg your pardon, but I—I—was
not prepared to see a young lady.”</p>

<p>“What then?” Again the lady smiled so
delightfully that Lucie smiled in return as she
said: “Oh, an old man, quite an old one.”</p>

<p>“Then you must be disappointed.”</p>

<p>“O, no, quite the contrary.”</p>

<p>“I am Mlle. Lowndes, Nora Lowndes.”</p>

<p>“Then you are not French.”</p>

<p>“No, I am an American.”</p>

<p>“Then, won’t you please speak English?
It has been so long since I heard it.”</p>

<p>“You speak English?” Miss Lowndes looked
surprised.</p>

<p>“But yes. I speak it, you see, because my
mother is American, and would have me speak
as well as read her language.”</p>

<p>“How perfectly delightful. It is much easier
for me, of course. Let us begin right away.
Shall I sit here? Of course you want to know
about your father first thing and then we will
talk business.”</p>

<p>“You have seen my father? You know him?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, for I have been helping the nurses at
Madame Hautecœur’s chateau which she has
given for a convalescents’ home during the
war. I have just come from there.”</p>

<p>“Oh, miss, you have just come? You have
seen him so recently?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>“Only three days ago. He was looking much
better, still a little pale as would be expected
from one so long a patient in a hospital, but still
doing very well, and soon able to go back to his
regiment. You cannot believe what that letter
from the young soldier, what is his name? did for
him. He seems to have taken on new life, and
I do not wonder, all these months without a
word of his wife and daughter.”</p>

<p>“It was this way, you see: at first Paulette
would not let me write because we were at such a
pass, unhappy refugees. We were expecting
every day to meet my grandfather and that
everything then would be settled, but you see my
grandfather never came. Does my father know
about this? That we shall never see dear grandfather
again?”</p>

<p>Miss Lowndes laid her hand caressingly on
Lucie’s. “Yes, dear child, he knows; your
friend told him in his letter.”</p>

<p>“That was kind, but it was like Victor
to do it. He would know that it might be hard
for me to tell my father.”</p>

<p>Miss Lowndes nodded. “I like that Victor.
And so you did not write to your father at all?”</p>

<p>“Not at first, but after a while, but it seems
he did not get the letter. Then we found that
he had been moved to another hospital and did
not know where to write. You see, mademoiselle,
Miss I mean—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>Miss Lowndes smiled. “That isn’t the way
we say it, dear. We would say Miss Lowndes,
or just go on talking without saying Miss anything.”</p>

<p>“I am forgetting some of my English, I am
afraid. You see, Miss Lowndes, Paulette, she is
the old peasant woman who took care of me when
I was a baby, and who has always lived with us.
Paulette is so lost here in Paris, and I am a very
ignorant little girl. Neither of us knew where
to go to find out about things; Paulette would be
afraid, anyway, for she has a great fear of
governments and officials, and but for Victor
I do not know when we should have heard about
papa.”</p>

<p>“And who is this nice Victor person?”</p>

<p>“He is the cousin of my best friend, Annette
Le Brun who lived next door to us, at least she
was my best friend; I do not know that I shall
ever see her again, but now I have Odette.”</p>

<p>“Tell me about Odette.”</p>

<p>“She is also my next door neighbor. Like
myself she is a refugee, but it is much worse for
her. I have Paulette who loves me and would
work her fingers off for me, but Odette has lost
her father and mother. She has no one at all
but a cross old great-aunt who wishes her off her
hands. You understand then, miss, I mean Miss
Lowndes, that it is not very happy for Odette,
though since we have become friends it is better.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
She is so bright, so full of courage, this Odette,
that I admire her much.”</p>

<p>“I must make her acquaintance, and Paulette’s,
too. I know I shall love Paulette. Now
to business. In this envelope is a sum of money
which your father sends. I am sure you must
need it, for I really don’t see how you have
managed all this time.”</p>

<p>“Paulette had her savings, you see, and then
for a time she had good work in two families
as <i>femme de ménage</i>. They have left the city,
unfortunately, and now poor Paulette works in a
laundry where she gets small pay, but it is much
better than nothing.”</p>

<p>“Dear Paulette, what a treasure she must be.
Now, then, this is not your allotment to which,
as the daughter of a captain, you are entitled. I
shall see to your getting that, but your father
wishes that you have this, too, every month,
and I shall see that you receive it, that is, so long
as I am in the city and you are here, too.”</p>

<p>“Paulette is always talking of going to the
country where she can work in the fields, which she
would like much better than what she is doing.”</p>

<p>“I don’t blame her. We shall have to talk
about that later on. I am working with the
Committee for Devastated France, and shall be
here until I am sent elsewhere. Now, dear
child, if there is anything I can do I want you to
be sure to let me know. I want you to feel that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
you have a friend, a countrywoman of your
mother, whom you can turn to at any time. I
will give you a card with the address which will
always find me.”</p>

<p>“My mother, I don’t suppose my father has
heard anything of her,” said Lucie wistfully.
“Has he any idea where she is?”</p>

<p>“I am afraid not. We think she must be in
one of the towns behind the German lines, so of
course she cannot communicate with her people.
There is no reason to believe she is not safe. We
are all making every effort to get news of her but
so far have not succeeded. You shall know the
very instant we do hear anything. Let me see,
I suppose Sunday would be the best day for seeing
Paulette, and Odette, too. Of course you,
dear child, are to look upon me as a friend, but I
want to find out things that can be done for any
refugee, and this little Odette, I want to learn
more about her. I cannot stop now, but Sunday
I shall see you again, and please call me
Miss Nora, it sounds so much more friendly.”
She stooped to give Lucie a kiss and went off
casting a bright glance over her shoulder as she
went out.</p>

<p>Lucie lost no time in hunting up Odette. This
most wonderful thing must be talked over at
once, then, when that was discussed from every
side, there was the long letter to her father to be
written, so that the afternoon was all too short,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
and Paulette came near finding no dinner ready
when she arrived.</p>

<p>Lucie showed her the money triumphantly,
saying: “And now you will not have to go to
that old laundry any more.”</p>

<p>But Paulette was entirely too canny to agree
to this. “Why should I not?” she asked. “Am
I then to throw away good money merely that I
may sit with my hands folded? I shall work
while I am able, for the winter at least, and in
the spring we shall see what we shall see.”</p>

<p>The next pleasant thing to happen was the
Sunday visit of Miss Lowndes, who made herself
so agreeable that even Paulette, chary of praise
at most times, declared her a “young lady of
parts.” Following this event came the letter
from Victor. An amusing letter it was, of
rollicking nonsense, and giving no hint of discomfort
or discouragement.</p>

<p>“About those shoes,” he wrote, “I am very
glad they were left at your door. I think Pom Pom
must have sent them, at least when I asked
him about them and charged him with being the
giver he did not deny it, but looked very conscious,
and from his expression I should surmise
that he knows more than he chooses to tell. Very
pretty of him, wasn’t it, to send you a parting
gift? By the way, he has captured all hearts,
if he has not yet captured a Boche, but we all
expect such great things of him that there is no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
telling what I shall have to report when I next
see you.”</p>

<p>In consequence, so far as the shoes were concerned,
Lucie was no wiser than before, and
concluded that whatever Victor might know he
did not mean to tell; therefore, Paulette advised
her to accept the situation and wear the shoes,
which she did.</p>

<p>So the weeks wore on. Autumn slipped into
winter. Christmas came and went, rather a
sorrowful day for all in spite of an effort on the
part of every one to make it bright and cheerful.
Miss Lowndes came with little gifts for Paulette
and Lucie, and a basketful of food for the old
women next door, but no one felt very gay;
memories were too poignant.</p>

<p>But the New Year brought two bright occurrences.
Jean had his first permission, granted
every four months to the men in the trenches,
but somehow a little delayed in his case. Paulette
took a week’s holiday and undertook to
show her son the city, with Lucie and Odette as
two of the party. Big, honest Jean was rather shy
before Lucie, whom he knew only as the young
lady of his former employer’s family, but he was
more at home with Odette, who presented him
with Nenette and Rintintin to his delight and
Paulette’s satisfaction. It was while he was
still on leave and was making his daily visit to
his mother that news came from Captain Du<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
Bois, news that made Lucie happier than any
gift, for he wrote that he had had a message from
her mother, a mysteriously sent message, believed
to have been smuggled in by some one
through the German lines. At all events there
was no inkling of how it was sent. The words:
“I am safe and well,” were all the message contained
but they were enough to cheer Lucie and
her father.</p>

<p>“Nothing, no New Year’s gift, could have
made me so happy,” Lucie told Miss Lowndes
who had come in that very day. “Perhaps next
year the war will be over and we shall be together
again in our home.”</p>

<p>“I would not expect too much, dear,” said
Miss Lowndes, “though now I think you may
hope to see your mother again.” And this hope
buoyed Lucie up in many of the tragic days to
come.</p>

<p>After Jean’s departure Paulette went back to
her work, but because of her son’s insistence she
shortened her hours and reached home while
it was still daylight. “I shall not have a happy
moment if I know you are out after dark,” he
said. “With those Zeppelins about I shall not
be satisfied to have you exposed at night.”</p>

<p>“But they may come in daylight, and one is
not safe in one’s own home,” protested Paulette.</p>

<p>“Just the same I shall not be satisfied,” returned
Jean doggedly, and Paulette yielded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>Perhaps it was just as well that she did, for
along in March came a disaster which, literally,
struck near home, and which affected each one of
the little group occupying the rooms overlooking
the old convent garden. It was poor old Amelie
Durand who was the victim. She was coming
home when the Zeppelin swooped down upon
Paris to do its deadly work, and with others she
was killed. Lucie, trembling and terrified at the
news, cowered in a corner of her room till Paulette
should come. In the next room, Odette, pale
and shivering, but outwardly calm, did what she
was told to do. She had no great love for this
aunt of hers, old Amelie Durand, but she was
her nearest of kin and this stroke of fate seemed
even more ghastly than the others which had
taken the ones most beloved. It was a time of
fear, of dread, of confusion. Curious visitors
came and went. There were footsteps on the
stairs going up or down all day long. Officials of
the government came to investigate. Old Henriette
Jacquet, Amelie’s friend and companion,
worked up to a state of excitement which made
her ill, talked incessantly in a shrill, high key,
to any one and every one who came in.</p>

<p>Lucie, who heard and saw most of all this, felt
as if she were in worse case than upon that
dreadful journey to the city. She started at
every sound, dreading that she would next hear
the threatening hum of another Zeppelin. Paulette<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
listened to the tale of the disaster with set
lips and lowering brows. “And I said I would
not work in a munition factory, because of the
danger,” she said nodding meditatively. “Where
is one safe these days, surely not here in Paris.
If those Boches can get here once, they can
again.” She did not go out the next day, but she
spent much time with old Henriette while Odette
stayed with Lucie.</p>

<p>One morning Odette announced that Henriette
had declared that she would not remain
another week in the city. She had relatives
near Poitiers and to them she would go.</p>

<p>“And what will you do, Odette?” asked Lucie
with concern. This question had been in her
mind ever since Amelie’s death.</p>

<p>“I do not know,” Odette answered after a
moment. “I think I shall go into a munition
factory. One can get work very easily, they tell
me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but Odette, I don’t want you to go into a
munition factory. I am afraid you will be killed.”</p>

<p>“One may as well be killed that way as by a
Zeppelin, and the pay is excellent.”</p>

<p>“Do you want to go, Odette?”</p>

<p>Odette looked at her with an inscrutable
smile. “Has that anything to do with it? I
place myself in danger, perhaps, but so do our
soldiers and do they hesitate? I shall be helping
France.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>“To be sure, but there are other ways of helping.”</p>

<p>“How and where?”</p>

<p>“In the fields. They say help is needed there
for planting the crops. We shall need all the
food we can get, and it seems to me that I should
prefer that kind of work.”</p>

<p>“I should prefer it, but I do not know where to
go or how to get there when I do know.”</p>

<p>“We can ask Miss Lowndes. I am sure she can
tell us. Please, Odette, promise me that you will
do nothing till I find out from Miss Lowndes.”</p>

<p>“And in the meantime am I to accept charity
from Henriette Jacquet? No, I thank you.
She has endured me simply because of my aunt.
She will be leaving in a few days at the most.”</p>

<p>Lucie sat silent and troubled. She would like
to have said at once that Odette must come in
with Paulette and herself, but she was not sure
how Paulette would regard such an arrangement,
and Paulette could speak her mind most positively
when she wished, without regard to those
concerned.</p>

<p>However, as if Paulette had read her mind she
presently appeared from next door. “Well,
my child,” she began, “I do not intend to stay
here to be annihilated by those Boches. Enough
of the city for me. We go. We go to the fields,
to the trees, the good earth. For me I have no
regrets.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>“When, when do we go?” asked Lucie eagerly.</p>

<p>“As soon as I learn some things that must be
learned,” responded Paulette oracularly. “In
the meantime we prepare. You will not be
<i>triste</i>, you, to go?”</p>

<p>“I shall regret nothing but leaving Odette.”</p>

<p>“There is nothing to regret there,” said Paulette
serenely, “for she goes with us.”</p>

<p>Odette sprang to her feet and threw her arms
around Paulette. “I? It is I, Odette Moreau,
that you mean? I do not then work in the
munition factory among strangers, but I shall be
with you, madame, and my Lucie?”</p>

<p>“Why not?” returned Paulette. “Have you
so many relatives that you cannot go with us?
I have settled it all with this Henriette Jacquet,
the stupid.” She did not explain why this
epithet, but Odette had reason to believe that
Henriette had not favored the arrangement, and
that her objections were based upon a possible
expense to herself.</p>

<p>Lucie settled herself comfortably on the arm
of Paulette’s chair. “Now tell us all about it,”
she said. “You love to be mysterious, Paulette,
but this is no time for mysteries. Neither Odette
nor I are in any frame of mind to be tantalized.
Just go ahead and tell us as much as you
know.”</p>

<p>Taken in this way Paulette was disposed to be
communicative. “I have told you that all is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
not ready, but so much is true that we adopt
Odette into the family. I have spoken to
Mathilde. This Henriette goes. We open the
door leading from our rooms into hers. The
rooms are taken by the month, and the month
is not up. We become one establishment in
this manner. By the end of the month we learn
where we shall go, and the rooms are given up.”
This was quite a satisfactory report, although Paulette
did keep back the fact that Henriette was
ready to go at once, because Paulette had made
it possible by paying the difference in the rent
from the present date to the end of the month.</p>

<p>So poor, old, worn, cross-grained Amelie
Durand passed into forgetfulness, and Henriette
was not long in making her exit, leaving no memories
which in any way affected the lives of her
associates in Paris.</p>

<p>Neither Lucie nor Odette had known such
happy days in Paris as the next few weeks
brought them. In the first place preparations
included the buying of new clothes, in which task
Miss Lowndes offered to take a hand, and which
meant several visits to the big shops which
neither girl had ever seen. Paulette, too,
turned to the American girl for advice, and because
her vision was clearer and her outlook
broader she was able to suggest things which
had not occurred to the peasant woman.</p>

<p>“I should say that the first thing to do was to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
write to Captain Du Bois and learn his wishes,”
said Miss Lowndes.</p>

<p>“I agree with you,” returned Paulette, “but as
I am not gifted with the pen, mademoiselle, perhaps
you will do this writing for me. You will
be able to put the case more clearly than the
child, Lucie, who will be guided by her own
desires.”</p>

<p>“I will gladly write, for I think I know conditions
pretty well. I suppose Captain Du Bois
must have relatives somewhere to whom you
might go.”</p>

<p>“I know of none who do not live in cities
or so far away that it would be a miserable
journey to reach them, but he has friends no
doubt, and at least can advise.”</p>

<p>“In the meantime I will be making inquiries
and it may be that a chance will come which will
be exactly what would be best.”</p>

<p>So the letter was written, but as it happened
the chance came neither through a suggestion
of Captain Du Bois, nor through any scheme of
Miss Lowndes, and while waiting for an answer
to the letter the girls and Miss Lowndes did their
shopping.</p>

<p>Lucie was quite ready to indulge herself in as
pretty and becoming clothes as she could afford,
but Odette—who would give her credit for so
much good sense?—Odette insisted upon such
things as she had always worn, the simple dress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
of a little peasant. “I am to work in the fields,
mademoiselle,” she said. “How long would
such a frock as Lucie’s serve me? Again I shall
be thrown with the country people and I do not
wish them to laugh at me or to think I am putting
on airs.”</p>

<p>Miss Lowndes looked at her quite taken aback.
“Did you ever!” she exclaimed. “I did not
think of that, Odette,” she said. “You are
wiser than I.” She told Paulette about it when
she next saw her. The good woman nodded
approvingly. “She is clever, very clever, that
Odette.”</p>

<p>“And if you could have seen how pretty she
looked in the hat that was tried on her.”</p>

<p>“No doubt, no doubt, but beauty is only skin
deep, and does not earn the bread and butter as
readily as quick wit and busy hands.”</p>

<p>“Yet Odette is quite pretty; she has lovely
eyes. She is not so good looking as Lucie, to be
sure.”</p>

<p>“She should not be. She is a skinny little
cabbage, but she will do. If she turns out as well
as she has begun, she will not be half bad. I
shall keep my eye on her.”</p>

<p>Paulette spoke meditatively and Miss
Lowndes wondered a little what was in her mind.
She was to discover in due course of time.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br>

<small>OLD FRIENDS AND NEW</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THEN suddenly appeared Victor on his
second permission, and wearing a sergeant’s
stripes, won for his tact, his influence
over the men, and for his bravery during a night
raid. But of this exploit he would say nothing,
merely laughing off the question when Lucie
asked him how he had earned his promotion.
“I did nothing at all, nothing more than any
one would have done if he had had the same
chance. They gave me my stripes simply because
of my youthful beauty.”</p>

<p>He came in with a rush and a dash, immediately
making the whole place seem fuller of
life and action. “What’s all this I hear?
What’s all this?” he asked after the first
salutations, “going away, are you? Well, I
can scarcely blame you. Where are you going?”</p>

<p>“We don’t know yet,” Lucie answered.</p>

<p>“Then I am wiser than you. I know, I
know.”</p>

<p>“Then why did you ask?” Lucie gave his
arm a little tap, making him drop the match
with which he was lighting his cigarette. “You
did it just to tease. How do you know?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>“Aha! Revenge! Revenge! I shall not tell
you, because you spoiled my light.”</p>

<p>“You will have to tell Paulette.”</p>

<p>“How do you know I will? I’m not afraid of
Paulette. She is not a Boche.”</p>

<p>“And are you afraid of a Boche?”</p>

<p>Victor laughed and took from his pocket a
letter which he handed to Paulette. “It is
from Captain Du Bois,” he said.</p>

<p>Paulette took it with an air of importance and
went to the window to read it, a slow process
with her.</p>

<p>“You have seen my father, then, Victor?” said
Lucie. “Do tell me how he looks.”</p>

<p>“Fit as a fiddle. We had a long talk and he
charged me with this letter to Paulette.”</p>

<p>“And have you none for me?”</p>

<p>“No, but I have a message from Pom Pom.”</p>

<p>Lucie looked wistfully over at Paulette, whose
lips were moving as she laboriously read the
words before her. “I think I might see the
letter, too,” she said.</p>

<p>“You don’t want Pom’s message then. You
don’t look interested,” said Victor.</p>

<p>“Oh, I do want it, but of course I am more
interested in what my father has to say. What
is Pom’s message?”</p>

<p>“He says to tell you that when those shoes
are worn out he will send you another pair if
he has to rob a Boche to get them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>“What nonsense! How is the dear little
fellow, and why didn’t you bring him with you?”</p>

<p>“I was afraid he wouldn’t want to go back,
and I’d hate to have him shot as a deserter.
The boys are all devoted to him. My friend
Honoré has him in charge while I am on
leave.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, Honoré. Shall you see his family
this time?”</p>

<p>“Happy thought! Why not all of us go out
there for another good meal. It will please
them to see us and to hear from the lad, and then
you would like to make your adieux, wouldn’t
you?”</p>

<p>“If I could but tell where we were going.
Paulette—”</p>

<p>But Victor interrupted any information by
crying out: “Don’t tell her, Paulette. Don’t
tell. It is a secret.”</p>

<p>Lucie gave her head, an indignant toss. “I
think you are too horrid for words,” she cried.
“I shall not stay any longer. I will go to
Odette, and you two can keep your old secrets.”
She flounced out of the room, leaving Victor
and Paulette laughing and whispering together.</p>

<p>However, she could not long keep out of
humor with Victor; he was too full of his
jokes, in too rollicking a mood to be withstood,
but Lucie would not ask him another word about
the secret, though she listened to his plans for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
holiday making. It was only after he had gone
that she questioned Paulette. “I think I should
see my father’s letter,” she remarked with
dignity.</p>

<p>Paulette smiled, lifted her eyebrows and
shrugged her shoulders. “But no, my child.
I promised Monsieur Victor that I would not
show it.”</p>

<p>“Then it must have some very unpleasant
word in it.”</p>

<p>“On the contrary.”</p>

<p>“Of course that Victor likes to tease, but I
did not think you, Paulette, would be unkind
to your Lucie.”</p>

<p>Paulette’s sly look of amusement vanished.
“I, unkind? I would not be that, my pigeon.
Now, what would you? I promise monsieur
that I will not tell because he wishes to give you
a pleasant surprise. I can say so much, a very
pleasant surprise. He is a good lad. Will you
then deprive him of this satisfaction, when he has
done so much for us? He is quite excited over
this, and would be greatly disappointed if I
revealed the secret.”</p>

<p>Lucie sighed. “Very well, then, I will not
insist. But can you tell how soon I am to
know?”</p>

<p>“Let me see. To-morrow we pack. We
also go to this meal at the restaurant. That
is enough for the day. I think by the day after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
we may begin our journey. At the end of the
journey you will know.”</p>

<p>“Two days, two whole days. Well, there
will be so much going on that I will have no
time to sit and think about it, there is that to
say. We must say good-by to Miss Lowndes.
I wonder, by the way, if she knows?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps. I will ask Monsieur Victor.”</p>

<p>Victor satisfied them on this point when he
appeared the next morning. Yes, he had seen
Mlle. Lowndes, a charming young lady. He
liked blue eyes. He made the last remark with
a sly glance at Lucie.</p>

<p>“I suppose that is because you have blue
eyes yourself,” she retorted.</p>

<p>“Perhaps. I do not know,” he returned
serenely.</p>

<p>“And I suppose you let her into the secret.”</p>

<p>“It was what your father asked that I should
do. He did not wish her to concern herself
about your affairs any longer than was necessary.
He knew that she would go to any amount of
pains to relieve your situation, but happily she
turned all this over to me, your humble Victor.”</p>

<p>“Humble!” scoffed Lucie, and Victor
laughed.</p>

<p>The meal at the Restaurant Honoré, while
not quite so great a success as before, was merrier.
Odette was of the party and was so excited that
she sparkled and bubbled over with fun, matching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
Victor’s saucy speeches with wittier ones,
till Lucie felt herself quite cast in the shade.
She was glad that Odette was having so good a
time, but she was rather aggrieved that she
was not placed more to the fore. She was still
brooding over the secret, and more than once
was far away in thought while Odette and Victor
chatted and made merry. She was not sorry
to leave Paris, but this going to the unknown
was not in the manner of an ordinary undertaking
and she wondered what the new life
would be like.</p>

<p>She was so silent on the way home that Victor,
too, became grave and asked her very seriously:
“What is the matter, Lucie? Are you really so
angry with me?”</p>

<p>She shook her head and sighed.</p>

<p>“Then what is it? Are you sorry to be leaving
Paris, or have I said something to hurt your
feelings? I like blue eyes, of course, but I
really like brown ones better.” And then
Lucie laughed.</p>

<p>“You foolish boy,” she said, “as if I would
care for a silly thing like that. Why should I
care what sort of eyes you prefer?”</p>

<p>“But I should much prefer that you liked
blue eyes. Do you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether I do or not. It
isn’t a matter that I ever think about.”</p>

<p>“No,” returned Victor reflectively, “I don’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
suppose you do—yet. I hope we shall have fine
weather for our journey to-morrow, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Our journey? Are you going, too?”</p>

<p>“Of course. I promised your father that I
would see you to the very end of it, and take
word back to him of how you fared.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t tell me that before.”</p>

<p>“No, but I tell you now. I hope you are
going to be comfortable and happy, happier
than you have been here.”</p>

<p>“It has not been so bad of late, but I shall
not be grieved to go. I am longing for spring
in the country. Is it real country to which we are
going? You can tell me that much, can’t you?”</p>

<p>“I think one would call it real country.”</p>

<p>“I shall like that better than any town,
unless it were our own little town, which after
all is more like country than city.”</p>

<p>“I think you will like it. I hope so.”</p>

<p>“Is it far?”</p>

<p>“That depends upon what you call far. It
would be quite a walk, not so great a distance
to drive, and still less if one went by train.”</p>

<p>“And how do we go?”</p>

<p>“By train. Now I shall not tell you another
word or you will worm the whole secret out of
me. That Odette is a bright child.”</p>

<p>“She is older than I.”</p>

<p>“But you are still a child, very much of a
child.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>“You are not much more yourself.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, or I would not be in the army.”</p>

<p>“You tell us very little about it. I heard
more when you were talking to Madame and
Monsieur Pierre to-day than I have heard at
all.”</p>

<p>“One does not want to talk when one is away
from the trenches. One likes to forget, although—”
He paused and a far-off look came
into his eyes, making him look older, and giving
Lucie a feeling that he was distant in thought.</p>

<p>“Shall you be glad to get back?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I think so,” he answered slowly. “Yes,
yes, of course. One is glad. The others are
there and one must get back to them.”</p>

<p>That was all the talk for the moment but it
left Lucie with an understanding of the other
side of Victor’s character. Later she was to
appreciate even more clearly that he was made
of finer stuff than she imagined.</p>

<p>Miss Lowndes came in the afternoon, bringing
little parting gifts to all. “I am sorry to
lose you three dears,” she said, “but I do not
despair of meeting you all again. You will
write to me, Lucie, and tell me all about everything.
I am so interested. Really I shall
miss you very, very much. Perhaps I may
have a chance to go your way one of these
days. We all like to get away to nice, quiet,
safe places for a rest when we are utterly worn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
out. I am coming to see you off to-morrow,
and I am glad you have such a reliable escort
as that nice Victor Guerin. I hope he will
always look me up when he comes to town on
leave, and I hope he may be spared,” she added
gravely.</p>

<p>That Victor might not be spared the fate of
so many, many of the brave <i>poilus</i> had not
occurred to Lucie. He was such a live person,
that it was impossible to connect him with
anything tragic. She gave Miss Lowndes a
startled look, and when Victor came that evening
all the chill of her attitude of the morning
had passed away. This might be the last time.
It was a dreadful thought, and she kept near
him, hanging on every word, fancying that the
memory of them might some day be all that she
had left of this friendship.</p>

<p>For the last time she stood at the little window
which looked down upon the deserted garden.
For the last time she saw the sunset gilding the
roofs and steeples of the city. The pigeons
would still be strutting down on the pavement
below when she was far away. The street
noises would be as distinct to-morrow though
she would not be hearing them. The thoughts
made her pensive yet not sad. Odette came and
joined her. Lucie put her arm around the
slim waist of this little friend. “Are you sorry
that this is the last evening, Odette?” she asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>“No, no, no,” replied Odette vehemently,
“I am glad, thankful. I should not be if I
were not going with you and good Paulette.
This place is full of horrors, but it has given me
you and Paulette so I do not hate it; otherwise
I should. My only happy memories of
Paris will be those in which you are.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you glad that Victor is going with us?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am if you are. He is a brave <i>garçon</i>,
but I feel more at home with that big Jean. I
am used to those like him. He reminds me of
the men who worked in the fields near my
village. I could never have offered Nenette
and Rintintin to Monsieur Victor, but to Jean,
yes, it was quite another thing; it was quite
natural.”</p>

<p>“But you chattered away like a <i>babillarde</i>
at the restaurant this morning.”</p>

<p>“Very true, but when I am excited I can do
that. It is not that one is afraid, but that one
does not wish.”</p>

<p>The swallows circled high above the chimneys.
The sun-shot clouds turned to gray. The
garden became an indistinct mass of grass and
foliage, and then the girls turned away.</p>

<p>They started early the next day. Paulette
all in a twitter of excitement. Had monsieur
the safe-conducts? Where was her green umbrella?
They must not forget to give Mathilde
the key. What was the time? They must not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
be late. At last the station was reached. Miss
Lowndes came running up at the last moment
with chocolate and fruit, and, best of all, with
a storybook in English for Lucie. The train
moved out. Paris was left behind.</p>

<p>Past towns and quiet villages, past green
fields and budding forests, and finally at a small
station they left the train. There was a little
village beyond, and beyond the village stretched
the cultivated ground of farmsteads. Victor
looked around and finally hailed an old man
with a <i>charrette</i>. “Ah, Jules, you are here.
That is good.” He turned to Lucie. “Will
you go in the <i>charrette</i> or will you walk?”</p>

<p>“How far is it?”</p>

<p>“About a mile, perhaps less. We can go in
the <i>charrette</i> and Jules can come back for the
luggage. The horse is rather old, you see, and
perhaps it would be best to spare him too heavy
a load.”</p>

<p>“I think I should prefer to walk after sitting
so long, and then one can see the country better.”</p>

<p>“Very well. And you Paulette, you Odette?”</p>

<p>“We will walk, monsieur,” both replied.</p>

<p>So they started off at a brisk pace, the old
man with the ancient horse bringing up the
rear. War had not touched this corner of the
world set apart from the raging of battles, the
stir of camps. All was of a Sabbath quiet, but
there were only women and children working<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
in the fields. In the trees where young leaves
were putting out, birds were nesting. A lark
soared singing overhead. It seemed as if he
might at last reach the drift of white clouds
piled up in the blue. Presently they came to
a little shrine set by the roadside. With one
accord all knelt for a moment. There were
tears in Lucie’s eyes when she arose. “It has
been so long since I saw one of those,” she
whispered to Odette.</p>

<p>“Do I not know? Do I not know?” returned
Odette in a tremulous voice. “It is
like coming home again.”</p>

<p>The little cart with the jogging horse passed
them and went on. Victor made a signal to
Jules as he passed, which was answered by an
understanding nod.</p>

<p>“You seem to know that old man,” remarked
Lucie.</p>

<p>“I have seen him once or twice before,”
responded Victor.</p>

<p>Paulette gave a little chuckle which quickly
changed to a clearing of the throat as Lucie
looked at her sharply. “It seems so like my
old home of childhood that I laugh,” she explained.</p>

<p>“Are you tired? Would you like to rest a
moment?” asked Victor.</p>

<p>“How much farther is it?” asked Lucie.</p>

<p>“We have come about half the distance. At<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
the top of the next hill we shall be able to see the
house.”</p>

<p>“Then you know it. You have been here
before.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, several times. That is why I
could conduct you, because I knew the way.”</p>

<p>Lucie stood still and lifted her face to the
sky. “How lovely it all is; those floating
fleecy clouds, this sweet-smelling air, the birds,
the trees. We shall be much happier here;
I am sure of it, aren’t you, Paulette?”</p>

<p>“It is what I have desired, to go to the
country,” she replied. “Let us get on, my
child.”</p>

<p>So they traveled on. At the top of the hill
Victor pointed out a low, long white house set
in an orchard, and surrounded by smaller
buildings. “That is where we go,” Victor told
the others.</p>

<p>“I hope they want us,” said Lucie. “It
seems strange to be going to people I never saw
before, and whom I know nothing at all about.
It is very good of them to take us in.”</p>

<p>“They will be glad enough to have helpers
in the fields, you may be sure of that.”</p>

<p>“But I shall not be that exactly, shall I?”</p>

<p>“Well, no; you will be a guest, rather more
like a guest.”</p>

<p>“But papa pays for me?”</p>

<p>“No doubt.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>Suddenly Lucie stopped short. “Victor! the
secret? Where is it? I forgot entirely. You
were going to tell me when we came to the end
of the journey.”</p>

<p>“But we haven’t quite come to the end.
When we reach the house I will tell you if you
want to know.”</p>

<p>“There is nothing at all familiar about the
place,” said Lucie, stopping again to look around.
“I am very sure I never saw it before, and it
is not in the direction of our home. I know
that is still occupied by the Germans and it
doesn’t look as if a German ever saw this part
of our dear France.”</p>

<p>Victor made no reply but continued on the
way downhill. A little farther on he turned into
a lane which led between rows of apple trees.
The little cart had already arrived. They
could see Jules, pointing, gesticulating. Two
or three persons came out of the house. A
figure detached itself from the group and came
running down the lane.</p>

<p>Victor turned to Lucie with a smile: “There
comes the secret,” he said.</p>

<p>“Lucie, Lucie, Lucie!” The call sounded
nearer and more excited as the figure approached.</p>

<p>Lucie paused, listened, looked, then she too
dashed forward crying: “Annette, Annette!”
And in another moment, laughing and crying,
the two friends were in each other’s arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>“Well, how do you like the secret?” asked
Victor as he came up. “Was it worth waiting
for?”</p>

<p>“It was, it was,” cried Lucie. “I never
dreamed it was this. How did it happen?
Tell me all about it.”</p>

<p>“First come to the house and see grandmother
and grandfather,” said Annette. “They
are so impatient to see you, my aunt, too, for
you see this is the home of my grandmother’s
sister.”</p>

<p>“And my old home,” put in Victor.</p>

<p>“Really, Victor? I never dreamed of all
this,” she repeated.</p>

<p>Annette urged her toward the house where
stood Monsieur and Madame Le Brun ready to
welcome her. The old lady held out trembling
hands and drew Lucie close, kissing her on each
cheek. “Ah, my little girl,” she said, “we did
not dream when we parted that such sad things
could happen to our dear France.”</p>

<p>Mons. Le Brun wiped his eyes as he faltered
out: “Your grandfather, my old and valued
friend, he is no more. It is hard to believe that
the good God has taken him, but I thank heaven
that you are spared; and your father, he is
safe, is he not?”</p>

<p>“So far as we know,” returned Lucie, “but
my mother, we do not know where she is.”</p>

<p>“In good time, in good time,” said Mons. Le<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
Brun soothingly. “And here is Madame Guerin,
Victor’s grandmother, who is eager to see you.”</p>

<p>Lucie saw a little bright-eyed woman who
greeted her affectionately, and who then went
forward to speak to Paulette and Odette and
bring them into the house.</p>

<p>“It is so wonderful to see you,” said Annette,
who could scarcely take her eyes off her newly
recovered friend. “When Victor wrote to ask
about your coming I could scarcely contain
myself with joy, for I felt as if you were lost
utterly. Oh, we shall have happy days together
in spite of hard times.”</p>

<p>“So it was Victor who thought of it.”</p>

<p>“Did he not tell you? It is like him to put a
commendable thing upon some one else. Come
here, Victor, and tell Lucie about how you
managed this thing.”</p>

<p>So Victor came over from where he was being
adored by his grandmother and told his tale.
“You see,” he began, “when your father knew
that Paris was getting to be unsafe and that
Paulette was anxious to get you away, he asked
me if I could think of any place where you
might be protected and happy and where
Paulette could also be. Immediately I thought
of this, my own home. I knew my grandmother
needed help in the fields and I thought it would
be brighter for all if you could join Annette.
Moreover, I knew my grandmother would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
only too glad to have you come, and that it
would be a consolation to your father to know
you were among friends. I told him my plan.
He urged me to write at once and so there you
are; the thing was accomplished.”</p>

<p>“And well accomplished,” said Annette with
satisfaction.</p>

<p>“And where did you see my father?” asked
Lucie.</p>

<p>Victor looked surprised. “It is easy to see
him. Didn’t you know that he and I are in the
same brigade?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know, but I am glad it is so. Where
is Odette? I want Annette to meet her. She
is such a dear girl, Annette, and we are great
friends.”</p>

<p>“The little peasant girl, do you mean?”
asked Annette rather superciliously.</p>

<p>“Joan of Arc was a peasant girl,” returned
Lucie reproachfully.</p>

<p>“So she was,” agreed Annette.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br>

<small><i>LE-COIN-DU-PRES</i></small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was a large farm, as farms go in that part
of the world, and had been in the family of
Guerin for many years. The head of the family
in former days had occupied the white chateau
on the top of the hill, but that had long since
passed away from the present branch of whom
there were left only Madame Guerin, her grandson
Victor, and another grandson, one Gaspard,
the son of Madame Guerin’s eldest child. Gaspard,
too, was in the army and was with the
troops at the Dardanelles. Annette spoke of
this cousin as a <i>beau gar</i>. He was still at home
when Annette arrived at the farm of <i>Le-Coin-du-Pres</i>.</p>

<p>“Is he as nice as Victor?” asked Lucie as
the two girls were sitting together in the twilight.</p>

<p>“He is better looking, I think, and older. He
will inherit the farm, of course.”</p>

<p>“And Victor?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Victor will arrive. He is of good stuff,
although in danger of being spoiled by his
grandmother who thinks the world of him.”</p>

<p>“And which do you like better of these two
cousins, Annette?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>Annette put her head to one side, and said
quite sedately. “One should not say which
of two young men one prefers. It should be
left to her parents.”</p>

<p>Lucie’s lips parted in surprise. “Did you
think I meant in that sense? I was thinking of
them as your cousins only.”</p>

<p>“Not such very, very near cousins; we have
not the same grandmother.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” Lucie was rather startled. Who had
been putting notions in Annette’s head since
she saw her last?</p>

<p>Then Victor came up. “I have been looking
for you two,” he said, seating himself on the
bench by Annette’s side and tossing a spray of
blossoms into Lucie’s lap. “The first of the
season,” he announced. “How do you like
<i>Coin-du-Pres</i>, Lucie?”</p>

<p>“I think it is lovely. I like this rambling
old house and the garden. The garden is
nothing as yet, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“In another month you will begin to see its
glory. Paulette and Odette, they are content?”</p>

<p>“Paulette doesn’t say much; you know her
way, but she remarked to me that at last one
could have a place to put things. She has been
pottering around the little house, giving Odette
all sorts of directions, and planning where they
shall put this and what they will have to eat
when the time comes, so I really think she is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
very happy. As for Odette, she is so pleased
to be in the country again that nothing else
counts. She has been so ordered about and
scolded by that old aunt of hers that I suppose
Paulette seems like a very angel of disposition,
though I should scarcely call her so. It
was good of your grandmother to let them have
the little house; it will mean home to them.”</p>

<p>“That was Victor’s doing,” Annette spoke
up. “He suggested it, and had Jules get it in
order; that was one of the things he was
particular to write about.”</p>

<p>As if he had not heard, Victor began whistling
a gay little tune. Then he remarked: “Four
more days and my leave will be up. The next
time I shall come here to spend all of my <i>permission</i>;
it should be in August, eight days
every four months for the men in the trenches.”
Alas, who could tell what might happen before
then? Certainly if Victor had any misgivings
he would not have said so. “To-morrow,”
he added, “we must show Lucie all over the
farm. Come, let us go in. It is getting damp.”</p>

<p>They went in to where, in the lamp-lighted
room, the older people were gathered; Mons.
Le Brun poring over the newspapers Victor had
brought, Madame his wife knitting, her delicate,
little old face outlined against the crimson
back of a big chair, and her small nervous hands
busy with her work. Madame Guerin sat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
where she could gather up the papers as her
brother-in-law had finished with them. A big,
sleepy cat was curled up in her lap—she did
not care for dogs—and her bright eyes scanned
the columns with sharp eagerness. She was
neither so small nor so frail-looking as her
sister, and appeared a person of decision and
energy.</p>

<p>Annette and Lucie seated themselves upon a
sofa. Victor sauntered over to the bookcase,
and began examining the volumes.</p>

<p>“Have you nothing to do, Annette?” Madame
Guerin inquired presently.</p>

<p>“No, <i>tante</i>, I don’t seem to have,” replied
Annette.</p>

<p>“Then you’d better find something. I dislike
to see a girl of your age sitting with her
hands in her lap.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do let her alone, Clothilde,” Madame Le
Brun protested peevishly. “She may do as
she pleases this evening when her friend has
just come.”</p>

<p>“You spoil her, Marcelline,” declared the
elder sister.</p>

<p>“Not more than you do Victor.”</p>

<p>Madame Guerin bridled. “Not more than
I do? You can say that when you know that
Victor is here on his <i>permission</i>, that he suffers
in the trenches and that nothing should be
denied him? What would you? Is a soldier<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
fighting for his country to be treated like an
idle girl?”</p>

<p>“Here, here, stop your quarreling, you two
old children,” spoke up Victor. “I will spend my
<i>permission</i> in Paris the next time, if you begin
to wrangle about me. Grandmother, may I
have this?” He held up a small book.</p>

<p>“What is it?” She turned her head, at the
same time pulling the cat farther upon her lap
from which he seemed in danger of slipping.</p>

<p>“It is selections from the discourses of Epictetus.
It belonged to my father.”</p>

<p>“It is not one of those objectionable books
unfit for a young man to read, and not to be
mentioned before young ladies?”</p>

<p>Victor laughed and opened the book at random.
“Listen to this and then you can judge if
it be improper. ‘What matters to me anything
that happens while I have greatness of soul?’”
He turned over a few pages and again read:
“Shall not the fact that God is our Maker, and
Father, and Guardian free us from griefs and
terrors?”</p>

<p>“You may keep the book, my child,” agreed
the grandmother, little knowing under what
circumstances she would see it again.</p>

<p>Victor slipped it into his pocket and went
over to where the two girls were whispering
together. He sat down by them and they
played some foolish games, smothering frequent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
bursts of laughter, till bedtime came. Then
Lucie was taken up to a little clean bedroom,
very tiny, but quite comfortable and fragrant
with the sweet spring odors. Annette was no
farther off than the next room, but Paulette
was separated from her by sweeps of grass,
garden paths and rows of apple trees. The
girl felt a little lonely, in spite of Annette. She
wondered if she would be able to avoid Madame
Guerin’s angles and Madame Le Brun’s exactions.
Of Mons. Le Brun she had no fear.
He was her grandfather’s friend and in her last
waking thoughts the dear grandfather had place.</p>

<p>Before the end of the week Victor departed,
and Lucie missed him. Always he was able to
smooth out the wrinkles, she told herself as
she sighed. Paulette and Odette were working
in the fields and she saw not much of them.
They were tired at night and were at their
labors before she was up in the morning. Madame
Le Brun, while insisting that Annette
should not be idle, was more lenient to Lucie,
over whom she considered that she had no
rights beyond seeing that she was comfortable.
So Lucie cast about for something to do, and
finally consulted Mons. Le Brun.</p>

<p>“What should you like to do?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I think it would please my parents if I were
to study, but it is hard to do that alone.”</p>

<p>Mons. Le Brun tapped the ends of his fingers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
together as he considered the question. After
a while he said: “How should you like that I
teach you Latin?”</p>

<p>“And I could teach you English?”</p>

<p>Mons. Le Brun laughed. “Very well, but
I do not promise that I am a very brilliant
pupil.”</p>

<p>“Annette already knows a little that I have
taught her,” Lucie told him. “I think it would
be well for her to join us, then she could study
Latin with me and English with you.”</p>

<p>Again the old man laughed. “Poor Annette
will then be doing double work, but never
mind, it need not be too hard for her. If I
get into difficulties as teacher I will go to the
good <i>curé</i> who will help me out.”</p>

<p>So the little class was begun. Madame Le
Brun and Madame Guerin nearly had a pitched
battle over it. One objected to the studies
taking place in the morning, for it was then that
Annette should be learning to sew, to preserve,
to do various household tasks. The other objected
to the afternoon because it interfered
with the hour when her husband read aloud to
her, but finally the morning had it, because it
was the man who preferred that time of day.
Therefore almost every morning after this
would be seen three heads bending over books
and papers, the blossoming apple trees a background
for Annette’s dark locks, Monsieur’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
gray ones and Lucie’s sunny brown ones. They
were never arduous tasks and judging from
the frequent laughter they were often amusing.</p>

<p>News from the outside world reached them
but slowly. The battle of Ypres was going on.
The Germans failed to pierce the British lines,
but Madame Guerin sighed and shook her head
at every fresh sacrifice of troops. The shocking
news of the <i>Lusitania</i> tragedy sobered every one.
The German successes gave a harder,
more determined expression to every face.</p>

<p>It was one glorious day in May that the bolt
struck nearer home. The morning lessons were
over. Lucie was lingering under the tree where
the chairs and table were set, when she saw
Odette running up from Paulette’s little house.
She arrived breathless, agitated. “Lucie,” she
cried panting, “where is madame?”</p>

<p>“In the house, I think. She came in from
the garden some time ago.”</p>

<p>“There is some one to see her. And, Lucie,
go, go yourself to Paulette; she wants you; she
needs you.”</p>

<p>In alarm Lucie ran down the lane, leaving
Odette to find Madame Guerin. The door of
Paulette’s little house stood open. Lucie did
not stop to knock but entered at once. She
saw a man with Paulette; both were bending
over something which lay on a chair. “What
is it?” exclaimed Lucie in alarm. The man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
turned around, showing a haggard face. “Jean!”
cried the girl.</p>

<p>He stepped back to allow her to come up to
the chair from which suddenly came a faintly
pitiful attempt at a bark. Lucie flung herself
on her knees. “Pom Pom,” she whispered,
“dear little Pom Pom. Oh, what is this that
has happened? Give him to me! Give him
to me, Paulette. He will like being in my lap.”</p>

<p>Paulette gently lifted the little creature from
the chair. “He appears to understand,” she
said, as Pom Pom feebly tried to lick Lucie’s
hand.</p>

<p>As Paulette uncovered him, Lucie perceived
that two of his legs were bound up, and that
he could not move without pain. The tears
flowed down her cheeks. “Poor, dear one,” she
crooned, gently stroking the soft little head.
Pom Pom’s eyes showed that he understood and
again he sought to lick her hand.</p>

<p>Then Madame Guerin came hurrying in.
“What is all this?” she asked. “A sick dog? I
don’t know a thing about dogs. If it were a
cat I might know what to do.” Then something
in Jean’s face made her stop short. “Who
is this?” she asked, “and why does he bring
the dog here?”</p>

<p>“I am sorry, madame,” began Jean in his
slow way, “but I am the bearer of ill news.”
He stopped and looked helplessly at his mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>“Who are you and whose dog is that?”
asked madame sharply.</p>

<p>“It is my son Jean,” said Paulette gravely.
“The dog is Monsieur Victor’s, and Jean has
brought him to us whom he knows and loves.”</p>

<p>Madame clenched her hands till they showed
the strain. “Victor?” she whispered. “He is
not—not—killed?” Her voice rose shrilly.</p>

<p>Lucie, too, made a sudden movement, causing
Pom Pom to utter a faint moan. She gently
touched his head and sat very still.</p>

<p>“He is not killed, no, madame, but he is very
seriously wounded,” Jean replied.</p>

<p>Madame recovered her poise. “Sit down, if
you please, and tell me all. You look tired.
Paulette, have you seen that he has food and
drink?” She drew up a chair and motioned
Jean to a seat. “If you are not too tired will
you please tell me,” she went on.</p>

<p>“It was at Arras,” Jean began, “the battle
there, you understand. Monsieur was wounded.
Night came. No one knew that he lay there.
There were so many, you see, and these others
were plainly alive. The little dog knew, oh, yes,
he knew that Monsieur Victor was not dead,
and he went out to find him. It was night.
No one saw him go. He returned. Oh, yes, he
returned wounded. The little dog, you understand,
was wounded. It was as he was coming
back to tell us. He managed to arrive. Figure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
to yourself, madame, the courage. It was Monsieur
Honoré, his friend, that he made understand.
We went out. We searched, and we
found him there so sorely wounded, that he
could not move. Monsieur Victor it was, and
we brought him back. He is at a hospital.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” whispered madame. “Will he—do
they think he will live?”</p>

<p>Jean shook his head doubtfully. “One cannot
tell. He was far spent when I saw him.”</p>

<p>“You saw him then, afterward? After his
wounds had been dressed.”</p>

<p>“Yes, madame.”</p>

<p>“He could speak? He spoke to you?”</p>

<p>“He sent for me. It was about the little
dog. He understood that it was the little dog.
He was very weak, but he could tell me his wish
that I would bring the little dog to Mademoiselle
Lucie. He told his colonel—I think it
was his colonel, and he said I should go. Monsieur
le Capitaine, mademoiselle’s father, was
there also. They said I should come, and I
came. I was afraid the little dog would die
before I arrived.”</p>

<p>The tears were falling from Lucie’s eyes upon
the head of the dog in her lap. “Poor Pom Pom.
Dear Pom Pom,” she repeated over and over.</p>

<p>Madame Guerin came and knelt by Lucie.
“And I said I did not care for dogs,” she murmured.
“If we can but save the life of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
one, never will dog have a better home, more
care.”</p>

<p>Lucie looked up fiercely. “But, madame,
you do not understand. He is mine. Pom
Pom is mine. It is I who will care for him. It
is because Victor had given him to me that he
sends him back. Next to Victor—Oh, yes, he
loved him best; I do not deny that, but next
to him he loves me.”</p>

<p>Madame arose without another word. She
stood for a moment looking down at Lucie and
the suffering dog, now lying very quietly. Then
she turned to Jean. “When do you return?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“To-morrow, madame.”</p>

<p>“I will go with you,” she said, and left the
room.</p>

<p>When she reached the house Mons. Le Brun
came out to meet her. “This is sad news,
Clothilde,” he said. “A message has just
come.”</p>

<p>“I have had the message from another
source,” she said. “I go to him to-morrow.”</p>

<p>For hours Lucie sat there. Jean and his
mother talked in low voices outside. Annette
came and begged to take Lucie’s place, but she
only shook her head. “He would rather stay
with me,” she said. “He knows me best.”</p>

<p>Odette stole in and out, stopping to ask if
she could bring water, milk, food. She crouched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
close to Lucie and they talked of the day they
first met. “It was then I was trying to make
a <i>poilu</i> of Pom Pom, do you remember?”
Lucie asked. “He became a true <i>poilu</i>, the
brave little man.” She bent her head and
softly kissed him above the eyes.</p>

<p>“He was so funny when he tried to sing,”
Odette remarked reminiscently. “He has done
many things for a little dog. One would not
think he could be so human. Put him in my
lap, Lucie. You must be so tired. Perhaps
he will not mind.”</p>

<p>“But he seems fairly comfortable now. I am
afraid if I stir he will suffer again. I will keep
him so for a while yet.”</p>

<p>After a while Paulette came in. “This will
not do, my child,” she began; “you will wear
yourself out. The poor little one will be quite
as comfortable on a bed I shall make for him.”</p>

<p>“No, no, I would rather stay. What is this
compared to his sufferings, compared to what
our brave men suffer? I can stand it. When
I can no longer I will give him up.”</p>

<p>The story had gone around of the dog’s
devotion to his master and those working on
the place flocked to see him, but Paulette
would not have one of them inside. “He would
be better off if they put him out of his misery,”
muttered old Jules.</p>

<p>“What’s that you are saying?” questioned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
Paulette. “What do you know about it? The
creature may get well.”</p>

<p>Jules shrugged his shoulders and walked away.
Then Marie came whispering, then young Michel,
very much interested, as what boy would
not be? It was Michel who offered to go for
the doctor. “He will come, even if he is not a
beast doctor,” he declared. “Oh yes, he will
come when I tell him.”</p>

<p>Paulette looked at Jean. Should she allow
this?</p>

<p>“Let him come,” advised Jean. “He may
not be able to do much good, but he can perhaps
give something that will cause sleep.”</p>

<p>So off Michel went to the village and came
back with the old doctor who very tenderly
examined Pom Pom, and then shook his head.
“He cannot recover,” was his opinion. He
looked sharply at Lucie. “My child,” he
inquired, “how long have you been sitting
there?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” returned Lucie, “but I do
not want to move while Pom Pom needs me.”</p>

<p>Without further words the doctor lifted the
little dog and laid him on the bed Paulette had
prepared for him. “He will be better off there,”
declared the doctor, “and you can sit by him.
Brave little dog, I will not let you suffer.”
Pom Pom moaned a little as the doctor gave the
quieting drug, but was soon quiet again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>Lucie rose, feeling stiff from so long sitting in
a cramped position. The doctor stood looking
thoughtfully at the little dog, now very quiet.
Paulette followed the doctor to the door to
which he beckoned her. “There is about one
chance in a hundred,” he told her. “I think
there is a bit of shrapnel for which I should have
to probe; otherwise blood poison will set in,
if it has not done so already, and the little
chap will be done for. The little girl will be
worn out. Hers is a beautiful devotion only
surpassed by that of the dog. If she will
consent to allowing me to take the dog home
with me where I have the necessary appliances,
I will do my very best for him. Explain to
her that it is the only chance, and that I hardly
think he can be saved, but in my opinion it is
worth while to try.”</p>

<p>Paulette returned to the room and reported
what the doctor had said. “I cannot bear to
let him go when I may never see him again,”
Lucie spoke distressedly.</p>

<p>“But, my child, it must be very soon that you
do part from him unless the doctor makes this
effort.”</p>

<p>“I know, I know,” acknowledged Lucie.</p>

<p>“It is very kind of this good doctor. It is
extraordinary that he should be willing to do
this for a dumb beast,” Paulette argued.</p>

<p>“It will hurt him dreadfully, won’t it?” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
Lucie, lifting tearful eyes to the doctor who now
came back into the room.</p>

<p>“I shall put him under ether, and he should
not suffer so much as he has been doing.”</p>

<p>“Shall you have to keep him long?”</p>

<p>“If he improves I think he can return in a
week, perhaps.”</p>

<p>“If he does not improve?”</p>

<p>“One cannot tell. Be assured that I shall
not permit him to suffer needlessly, and that I
shall do my utmost for him, as I would for any
other soldier of France.”</p>

<p>Lucie looked up gratefully. “You are very
good, and I trust you. I believe that you can
cure him, so please take him.”</p>

<p>“Do not expect the impossible, my child, but
what can be done shall be. It is a small service
to give a hero such as he is.”</p>

<p>Lucie bent over to take a last look at Pom
Pom. He lay very quiet. She went to the door
and called Michel who was waiting to hear what
the doctor might say: “Michel,” she said,
“please go to the house and ask Mlle. Annette
to give you the little flag which is pinned up in
my room.”</p>

<p>Michel sped away, and returned in a twinkling
with the flag. He followed her into the house
and watched while she spread the colors of
France over the little dog.</p>

<p>“It is the last thing I can do, and I think<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
Victor would like it,” she told the doctor. “If
he dies will you please let him be buried with it?”</p>

<p>The doctor nodded and turned away biting
his lip. He was used to pathetic scenes but
this was out of the ordinary. Paulette brought
a basket and they lifted Pom Pom and his bed
into it. Jean carried it out to the doctor’s
gig. As the doctor drove off Jean stood at
salute and Michel, not to be outdone, followed
his example. The daylight was fading. The
rosy flush of apple blossoms became brighter
because of the rose of sunset sky. As the doctor
drove out of sight Lucie gave a quick sob and
buried her face on Paulette’s shoulder. “Is
there never to be anything but unhappiness in
the world?” she sobbed.</p>

<p>Paulette drew her gently into the house,
motioning to the others to keep away.</p>

<p>Michel turned to Odette. “I think it was
fine to cover him with the flag,” he said. “He
is as great a hero as any.”</p>

<p>“It was also a beautiful thought of Mademoiselle
Lucie’s,” said Jean. “I shall tell the
<i>copains</i>.”</p>

<p>Odette nodded. She could not trust herself
to speak. Michel slipped away to his home, and
the brooding, sweet-scented May night settled
down upon the quiet farm.</p>

<p>In the house they were talking in subdued
tones. Madame Guerin was making her plans<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
for leaving with Jean. She sat by the table,
when Lucie came in, looking very pale and worn.
She had shed her tears, and now there was only
a dull ache in her heart.</p>

<p>Madame looked up as she entered. “You
are utterly worn out, you poor little one. She
must have some orange-flower water, Paulette.
I think you did not hear about the little book,
Lucie, that little book which Victor asked for
the last time he was here. Jean has brought
it to me. It is very precious, for it saved Victor’s
life. See where the hole is.”</p>

<p>Lucie took the little blood-stained book.
It had a stout leather binding, now torn and
defaced. It brought the horror of battlefields
very near. She laid down the book with a
shiver, then went over to the sofa. It could not
be that Victor, always so gay and joyous, should
be perhaps dying. How well she remembered
his reading from that same war-torn volume:
“Shall not the fact that God is our Maker,
and Father, and Guardian free us from griefs
and terrors?” No, she would not believe that
he would not get well. She had never believed
that she would not see her mother again and
she would have the utmost faith that, too, she
would see Victor and Pom Pom.</p>

<p>Paulette came in with the orange-flower
water. She drank it obediently. Annette, her
eyes red with crying, came to her. “Grandmother<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
has gone to bed with a nervous headache,”
she told her aunt. “She is all upset
because of all that has happened, but most, I
think, because of your going away.”</p>

<p>“That is Marcelline all over,” returned
Madame. “I should think if any one were to
be upset it should be I.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you have no idea of how long you
will be away?” remarked Annette.</p>

<p>“Of course not. How can I tell? I wish you
would not bring up such subjects, Annette.”
Then Annette understood the dread which
possessed her aunt, and the effort she was
making to be calm and brave.</p>

<p>Annette drew closer to Lucie. “Dear Lucie,
dear Lucie,” she murmured, “you are all
tired out. Come, let us go to bed. Grandfather
is upstairs, and grandmother went long
ago.”</p>

<p>So they went upstairs together, leaving
Madame Guerin alone with her fears and the
little stained book.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br>

<small>GASPARD</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was after Madame Guerin and Jean had
gone that Gaspard arrived. A tall, bronzed
young man he was, graver than Victor, very
gentle, very quiet. Lucie found him polite,
but it was very evident that he preferred Annette
to her. The two spent much time together
and Lucie felt rather lonely. Without
Madame Guerin’s brisk presence the house
appeared very still. Upon leaving, madame
had asked Paulette to have an eye to matters
domestic, not trusting entirely to the judgment
of the two young maids.</p>

<p>The first report of Victor informed them that
he was hanging between life and death, barely
holding his own, yet this much was more than
had been anticipated and every one was more
hopeful. Pom Pom, too, had come through
his ordeal satisfactorily, and while the doctor
could not, yet, give much encouragement he
did not discourage.</p>

<p>For some reason Odette placed the two in
the same balance. “If one recovers the other
will,” she declared to Lucie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>“Why do you say that?” Lucie asked.
“How do you know, Odette?”</p>

<p>“I do not know it; I only feel it. Something
tells me so.”</p>

<p>“I wish the something would tell you that
they are sure to get well,” responded Lucie.</p>

<p>Since coming to the country and spending
so much time out-of-doors Odette had grown
taller and stronger. She was naturally pale
but plentiful food had given her a healthier
look, and the haunting look of despair was
gradually leaving her eyes. She was industrious
to the last degree, and was popular with
those working both indoors and out. Paulette
was devoted to her, and once had said to Lucie:
“She is such a child as I should wish my little
Rose Marie to have been if she had lived, my
Rose Marie who died when she was but three
years old.” And Lucie considered that the
greatest compliment that Odette could have
received. The little peasant, however, showed
her pride by never seeking Lucie, but was always
delighted if Lucie sought her, as she did on
those days when Gaspard seemed to monopolize
Annette. The latter now was seldom
ready to study in the morning. She would
sit with her sewing in the living-room, Madame
Le Brun a watchful chaperon, while Gaspard
told of his experiences in the war.</p>

<p>Sometimes Lucie would listen for a while,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
but there was never as much laughter as during
the hour when Lucie stumbling over her Latin
nouns and Mons. Le Brun struggling with the
English pronunciation, made merry. Monsieur
always considered it a great joke to call Lucie
“Mees,” and to act the part of a little boy, so
if neither one made much progress at least
they heartened one another and made this
morning hour a pleasant one.</p>

<p>It was one day when talking to Odette that
Lucie made a discovery. Michel had just
brought the daily report from the good old
doctor. The boy never failed to do this errand
which he voluntarily took upon himself. Pom
Pom was better, a mere trifle better. It might
not be permanent. Another day would show,
perhaps.</p>

<p>“That is good to hear,” cried Lucie, her face
beaming, as Odette gave her the news just
learned from Michel. “Now we shall see,
Odette, if you are a true prophetess, when the
next news comes from Victor. If he is also
better I shall think that something which tells
you things has spoken the truth. I wish you
did not work in the fields till so late, Odette.”</p>

<p>“But it is right that I should.”</p>

<p>“I suppose so, but it leaves me without a
companion much of the time. When Gaspard
goes I suppose I shall see something of Annette
again. Of course it is her duty to entertain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
him, for Madame Le Brun cannot take responsibilities,
and in Madame Guerin’s absence
Annette is really the <i>chatelaine</i>.”</p>

<p>“There is Mons. Le Brun.”</p>

<p>“Yes, to be sure, but those two cannot spend
all the time together. I think Gaspard really
prefers the others, when it comes to that. It
seems rather peculiar, too.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Annette is a dear girl, and
I like to be with her myself because I, too, am a
girl, but Gaspard is a grown-up man. He is
three years older than Victor.”</p>

<p>“And you think grown-up men do not care
for the society of young ladies? I never heard
that before.” There was a little mocking look
in Odette’s eyes.</p>

<p>“Young ladies, yes, but Annette is not a
young lady.”</p>

<p>“I think you told me she is sixteen.”</p>

<p>“You are sixteen but you are not a young lady.”</p>

<p>“In two years she will be a young lady; she
will be of marriageable age. She is not too
young to be fiancée.”</p>

<p>Lucie looked at Odette, for a moment taken
aback. “Do you really think they are fianced?
I never in the world thought of that. I mean
to ask her. No, on second thoughts I would
rather ask Mons. Le Brun. I can be more confidential
with him these days than with Annette.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
I think if it is so that she should have told me,
old friends as we are.”</p>

<p>“It may not be arranged; it may be only
going to be.”</p>

<p>Lucie drew a long sigh. “When my friends
begin to grow up like this I feel very queer
and out of place. It makes me want my
mother.”</p>

<p>“It does make one feel that way,” returned
Odette.</p>

<p>“How do you know?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know; I only judge so.”</p>

<p>“One of those times when something tells
you,” said Lucie, laughing. “Well, Odette,
don’t you grow up and leave me.”</p>

<p>“I shall always wish to be near you whether
I am grown up or not,” returned Odette diplomatically.</p>

<p>“Well, I am going to hunt up Grandfather
Le Brun. I know I can get him to tell me anything.
<i>Au revoir</i>, Odette.”</p>

<p>“You will tell me what you learn?”</p>

<p>“If I may,” Lucie answered back and then
ran on to the house, to find Mons. Le Brun
smoking under the trees.</p>

<p>“Vell, Mees,” he greeted her, “’ow do you do?”</p>

<p>“Very well, sir.”</p>

<p>“Ver-r-ee vell, seer,” he tried to repeat.</p>

<p>“Very well, not ‘very vell,’ and you don’t
say ‘<i>seer</i>,’ you say ‘sir.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>“‘<i>Bien.</i>’ I say ‘Ver-ree ou-ell, sur.’ Correct,
no?”</p>

<p>“Much better, very much better. Monsieur,
I want you to tell me something. How do
people act when they are in love?”</p>

<p>“<i>Mon Dieu!</i> She wishes to conjugate the
verb <i>amo</i>. It is so long, mademoiselle, since I
played the young lover I should scarcely know.
I love; you love; he loves; that is how it goes.
But why do you ask? Are you perhaps falling
in love, with the doctor is it? There is no
one else but Gaspard, and Gaspard—”</p>

<p>“Exactly; it is Gaspard whom I mean.”</p>

<p>“But, my child—” The old man became so
agitated that he dropped his stick, which Lucie
hastened to pick up. “Gaspard—your parents;
you are so young, moreover Gaspard—” He
paused helplessly.</p>

<p>Lucie burst into a peal of laughter. “You
didn’t suppose I was talking about Gaspard and
myself?” She laughed again.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders. “They are impossible,
these females. One cannot tell what
they mean. You ask me about love. You
mention Gaspard. What am I to think?”</p>

<p>“Dear monsieur, forgive me. It is all my
fault. Come let us sit down under our own
tree of the morning study and I will explain.
I perceive that this Gaspard prefers Annette’s
society to yours or mine, and I begin to wonder.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
I forget that Annette will so soon be grown up;
when I do realize I see that it is quite possible
that they should be fianced, but Annette who has
always confided in me suddenly tells me nothing,
so I come to you.”</p>

<p>“You admit it would be a very good arrangement.
Annette will have a respectable <i>dot</i>;
Gaspard will inherit this place. We are old,
my wife and I. We wish to see Annette well
settled. I tell you this in confidence, because
of my old friendship for your grandfather and
of your friendship for Annette. Nothing can
be positively settled until Madame Guerin
returns, but then—we know her wishes upon
this subject and so you may guess how it will
turn out.”</p>

<p>Lucie lost no time in telling Odette what she
had found out. “You are the wisest creature,
Odette,” she said. “I should never in the world
have thought of this by myself. I don’t see
how you know so much. I am with Annette
much more than you and yet I didn’t suspect.”</p>

<p>Odette smiled a little demure smile. She
was much more sedate in these days than she
had been in the city. Probably she worked off
her surplus energy in the fields. “One sees
some things, hears some things, guesses the
rest,” she replied.</p>

<p>“Well, your eyes must be sharper than mine.
I confess I go about dreaming sometimes, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
that I suppose you do not. I look about at
things, you at people.”</p>

<p>“And things too.”</p>

<p>That night as Lucie was making ready for
bed she heard Annette stirring in the next
room. The night was calm and bright. The
nightingales were singing their hearts out. All
sorts of sweet odors were borne in through the
windows; the scent of lilac blooms, of apple
blossoms, of young green leaves, of newly worked
earth. Lucie tapped at Annette’s door and at
the invitation to enter she went in. Annette,
in her dressing gown, was kneeling by the open
window. Lucie knelt beside her. Neither girl
spoke for a time, then Lucie murmured: “How
unspeakably peaceful and lovely. Does it seem
possible that not so many miles away there are
terrible things going on?”</p>

<p>“That is what troubles one,” returned Annette.
“In a few days there will be another for
us to be anxious about.”</p>

<p>“You mean Gaspard? I know. Your grandfather
told me. Do you then care so much for
him, Annette?”</p>

<p>“He is my cousin.”</p>

<p>“Of course; I know that, but do you like
thinking of him as your fiancé?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, much better than of one I did not
know. He is good and kind.”</p>

<p>“But are you really in love with him?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>“Of course I shall be when he is my husband.
It would be quite out of place to say so now.”</p>

<p>“Then I know you are not. I shall never,
never consent to marry any one that I do not
truly love. My mother chose my father and
he chose her. They were madly in love.”</p>

<p>“That happens, of course it happens, but
quite the same one’s family make the selection
first.”</p>

<p>“It did not happen so in the case of my
parents. My mother was traveling in France.
She met my father at the house of a friend, and
at once they wished to meet again, and so they
did, many times. Then my father went over
to America and asked her parents, and they were
married.”</p>

<p>“That is not the way of my parents. It was
all arranged before they met at all. I think
I am very fortunate that it is Gaspard who is
selected for me by my grandparents. I like
him and he likes me.”</p>

<p>To Lucie’s mind this was a very mild way of
putting it. Her imagination rioted in more
romantic paths.</p>

<p>“Figure to yourself,” Annette went on, “how
it would be if your parents were to come to
you and say: ‘We have chosen a fiancé for
you, an estimable young man’; suppose we say
it is Victor; I mention him because he is one
you know very well; would you be so foolish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
as to declare that you would not marry him
just because you were not wildly in love with
him, a young man of good character, similar
tastes, in your own station in life and good
prospects? No, no, Lucie, it is because you are
so young and inexperienced that you think so.
You will change your mind when you are older.”</p>

<p>“When I am as old as my very experienced
and mature friend Annette,” returned Lucie,
laughing. “Well, Annette, if you are satisfied
that is all I am concerned with. I was afraid
maybe you were not and that made me unhappy.
I do hope Gaspard is good enough for
you.”</p>

<p>Annette turned around in surprise. “Good
enough? Of course he is,” she exclaimed.
“But, Lucie, do not take everything for granted;
there can be no actual betrothal until Aunt
Clothilde returns. She is coming soon, we
hope, and then Gaspard’s leave expires, and he
goes back.”</p>

<p>The thought which was in Lucie’s heart she
did not express. Suppose Gaspard should fall
in the war, what then? She gave Annette a
good-night kiss and went back to her room.</p>

<p>A few days later Madame Guerin returned.
Jules went to meet her in the old cabriolet,
but it was not Jules who came back with her
in it. He walked instead. Lucie, Annette and
Gaspard walked down between the rows of apple<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
trees to meet the returned madame. “But that
is not Jules with her,” said Annette suddenly.</p>

<p>Lucie turned her eyes from the drifting
blossoms, gave one quick exclamation and
darted forward, all her heart in her cry of:
“Papa! Papa!”</p>

<p>The gig stopped. Lucie clambered in to
cover her father’s face with kisses, and to
murmur little ecstatic words of endearment.
Then she climbed out again, running alongside
till the old vehicle reached the house. In her
joy of the moment she even forgot to ask about
Victor, and it was not till Gaspard made the
inquiry that she learned how he was.</p>

<p>“He is slowly improving,” madame told
them. “They do not know yet how much he
may be disfigured or whether he will ever regain
the use of his right arm. It is a long slow
road he must go, if indeed he recovers, yet there
is hope and that is more than at first was
given. That I should live to see him lying there
like that! I could do no good, they told me.
It is all a matter of time and of skilled attention
from the doctors. If there is any complication,
any change for the worse, they will notify
me.”</p>

<p>“But papa was as badly wounded, weren’t
you, papa?” Lucie spoke up. “And you see he
is quite well again. I know Victor will be, too.”</p>

<p>“It is cheering to have you say so,” responded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
madame, nodding to her, and continuing her
way toward the house, the others following
with her various bags and bundles, Lucie hanging
on her father’s arm and bringing up the rear.</p>

<p>Mons. Le Brun came to the door and looked
out to see what was causing all the talk and
excitement. He stopped short, looked puzzled,
then hurried forward with both hands outstretched.
“Marcel, my dear Marcel,” he cried.
“This is a surprise and a great joy.” Then he
embraced him, kissed him on each cheek, and
began talking and questioning at such a rate
that Lucie had no chance at all.</p>

<p>She took this opportunity to run around to
tell Paulette and Odette the news, creating
quite the sensation she desired. “<i>Mon Dieu!</i>”
exclaimed Paulette. “It is your father, Mons.
Marcel? How is this? Does he look well?
Does he remain long?”</p>

<p>“Come and see for yourself,” Lucie urged.
They started out toward the front of the house
but met Mons. Du Bois halfway, for he had
missed Lucie and had come in search of her.</p>

<p>“Running away so soon from your father, my
daughter?” he said.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, papa, but Mons. Le Brun was so
busy talking, so I came to bring Paulette.”</p>

<p>“Our good friend Paulette, our good friend.”
Mons Du. Bois took both her brown, work-hardened
hands and held them for a moment.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
“How can I thank you, Paulette, for all you have
done for this dear daughter?”</p>

<p>“I, monsieur? It is nothing I have done,
nothing to speak of. I would be criminal to
have done less, and what has she not been to
me? I could not have borne it all if it had not
been for her.”</p>

<p>“Odette, too. You must see Odette, papa,
my friend of whom I have written you,” Lucie
chimed in.</p>

<p>So Odette was brought out to be made known
to her Lucie’s father, and to greet him somewhat
shyly, but with a little dignity of her own.
Then Lucie bore her father off for a long, long
talk.</p>

<p>For some moments they sat looking in each
other’s faces for the changes the year had
wrought. The happy, childlike look had gone
from Lucie’s eyes. There was a more wistful
expression around her mouth, and her face in
repose looked very sad. She was not the merry
child of the last year’s spring. In her father’s
eyes was that far-seeing, rapt expression she had
once noticed in Victor’s. It was as if he had
seen visions, unearthly things. He looked older,
sterner. There were hard, set lines around his
mouth.</p>

<p>The change in him gave Lucie a strange, contracted
feeling about her throat. She wound
her arms around his neck and clung to him very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
closely while he held her tight. “It seemed as
if I should never, never see you again,” she
murmured. “It has been a whole year, a whole
year, papa, since those happy days in our own
home. You have heard nothing more?”</p>

<p>“Nothing.”</p>

<p>“But you think she is alive, that we shall see
her again?”</p>

<p>“I could not endure it if I believed otherwise.”</p>

<p>“They do send them back sometimes, don’t
they? those who have been taken into Germany.”</p>

<p>“Sometimes, yes, when they are no longer of
use.” He spoke in a bitter tone. Lucie sighed
and hid her face again on her father’s breast to
hide the gathering tears.</p>

<p>“I tried to be brave, papa,” she said brokenly.
“I still try, but sometimes it is very hard.”</p>

<p>“Do I not know that, dear daughter?”</p>

<p>“But soldiers are always brave.”</p>

<p>“They try to be; they always are outwardly,
but there are times when the spirit faints.”</p>

<p>“I am glad you tell me that, for there are
days when my spirit goes down, down into the
very depths, yet I am much better off than so
many many others, than Odette, for instance.
She has lost both her parents. You think there
is no doubt she is in Germany?” She went
back to the subject of her mother, of whom she
rarely spoke to any one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>“It is possible that she is in some one of the
captured towns.”</p>

<p>“Would that be better?”</p>

<p>“It might be; it might not. It all depends
upon the officers in charge. I think it is more
probable that she is in Germany, for we believe
that her message came through some escaped
prisoner who did not come my way and so
posted the message.”</p>

<p>“It was a great comfort.”</p>

<p>“The greatest in the world.”</p>

<p>Then they fell to talking of other things, of
the dear grandfather, of Victor, of Pom Pom,
till Michel came by where they were sitting, on
his way from the doctor’s. He waved his cap
when he saw Lucie. “He is better, mademoiselle,
and unless he takes a bad turn the doctor
thinks there is a good chance for him.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Michel, that is good news you
bring to-day,” Lucie answered cheerily. “Such
a good doctor, so kind, so devoted. His only
son has gone to the service and he has taken
up the practice again. He had retired, you
see, for he is quite an old man. The people
adore him, for he is just as attentive to the
poorest as to the richest. He came all the way
out here to see Pom Pom, and is watching and
nursing him as if he were his dearest friend.”</p>

<p>“There is much goodness in the world,” her
father returned thoughtfully, “but sometimes it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
takes great afflictions to make one realize it.
You are contented here, little one?”</p>

<p>“As much as I could be while things are as
they are, and much more so than in Paris. Of
course I long for the day to come when we can
go back to our own home. Paulette is always
talking about it. Will the war last so very
much longer? Can we go as soon as the
Germans have left our town?”</p>

<p>“I am afraid those are questions it would
take a wiser one than I to answer.”</p>

<p>“But you would like me to stay here till it
is safe to go back, and you will come when you
can to see me? It is farther away than Paris,
you know.”</p>

<p>“It does not appear that there is a better place
for you, here among friends, and I feel satisfied
while you have Paulette, she is such a good
devoted soul.”</p>

<p>“She is all that, and Odette, too. Then I am
satisfied if you are.”</p>

<p>Many other long talks did the two have
during Mons. Du Bois’s period of leave, and more
than one thing was settled during his stay,
among them the affair between Gaspard and
Annette. The two soldiers went off together
and life settled back into its former routine at
<i>Coin-du-Pres</i>.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br>

<small>UPS AND DOWNS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE days lengthened to weeks, the weeks
to months, but still the war continued, while
life went on uninterruptedly at <i>Coin-du-Pres</i>.
During the time that Victor was slowly creeping
back to life and strength at a distant hospital,
Pom Pom in the hands of his friends won out in
his race for health. Long before Victor was able
to be on his feet the little dog was running about
quite as if he had never heard of shrapnel or big
guns. To be sure he was a trifle stiff and favored
one hind leg when he ran, but he had full use of
three others and was as good as ever, Lucie
declared. If ever a dog was petted and pampered
it was he, though it was always Lucie whom
he followed, Lucie whom he wished to guard.</p>

<p>The good doctor dropped in frequently for a
friendly call, a chat with the girls about Pom
Pom, a talk with Mons. Le Brun about the
war. Lucie often listened to the discussions,
learning of the sinking of the <i>Lusitania</i>, of the
second battle of Ypres, of how the French in the
Champagne failed to pierce the German lines,
of Italy as a possible ally, of the fighting in Russia,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
in Turkey. The reports of the ups and
downs made the excitement of the days and were
discussed by every one from Michel up. The
year 1915 went out with no great encouragement
to the hopes of the Allies; 1916 came in with
little promise of sudden success, but it found
the same grim determination in the heart of
every soldier fighting for the Allied cause.</p>

<p>From time to time Lucie saw her father, who
could tell them of the battle of Verdun, assuring
them that though the Germans had taken Fort
Douaumont it was through heavy losses, and not
large results. This was in February. In July
began the battle of the Somme. It was while
it was in progress that ill news came to Paulette.
Jean Ribot was reported missing.</p>

<p>It was only in the first few moments that
Paulette collapsed. Old Jules brought the news.
There had never been very good feeling between
him and Paulette; the latter’s sarcasms were too
cutting, but there was only neighborly sympathy
on Jules’ face when he found Paulette out in the
field with Odette and the other workers. The
good woman looked dazed for a moment, then
she sank down upon a heap of newly cut hay and
covered her face with her hands. The others
stood around in respectful silence, though shaking
their heads at one another and whispering
little prayers.</p>

<p>It was Odette who broke the silence. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
stood, slender and firm, with uplifted head. “If
it be true, he has given his best for France,” she
said, “but I do not believe it is true.”</p>

<p>Paulette rose to her feet, wiped her eyes and
grasped Odette by the wrist. “Why, why, do
you say that?” she asked in a tense voice.</p>

<p>“That one is missing does not mean that one
is dead,” replied Odette. “He may be a prisoner.”</p>

<p>“Better he were dead,” mourned Paulette,
covering her head with her apron.</p>

<p>“And,” Odette went on, “there is a possibility
that he is neither. He may have lost
himself from his companions, and be wandering
in the woods trying to find his way back. For
me I shall not believe anything very bad has
happened till we know the truth.” And she
began again raking the hay.</p>

<p>Paulette stood still, pondering on Odette’s
words. “That is well said,” she spoke at last.
“There is enough disaster of which one has the
proof, why should one be desolated until that
proof comes?” Then she too turned back to
her work and all the rest followed her example.
In the week that followed Paulette was perfectly
calm and confident. If there were moments
when her heart misgave her, no one knew it but
Odette, to whom she would turn a troubled face
to receive in response a reassuring smile which,
some way or another, was all that was required
to restore Paulette’s equanimity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>Even Lucie had come to put confidence in
Odette’s “something tells me.” Had she not
maintained that if Pom Pom recovered it would
be a sign that Victor, likewise, would do so?
There was something almost uncanny in Odette’s
attitudes of mind. Probably it was nothing
more than she cultivated a cheerful optimism,
and, having suffered so much, made a practice
of pushing away all unnecessary and gloomy forebodings
simply because she had come to a place
where she could endure no more. She had
always assured Lucie that she was positive her
mother would return, and upon this Lucie
pinned her faith, discouraged and disheartened
as she was when months passed without any
word.</p>

<p>It was about two weeks after Jules brought
the report that Jean was missing that Odette’s
proof came in a very material and satisfactory
form, for who should walk in one evening but
Jean himself. Paulette who had been so brave
under ill news was now completely overcome.
She threw herself into Jean’s arms and wept on
his shoulder as if her tears would never cease.</p>

<p>Jean held her awkwardly and looked over at
Odette standing with a vivid light in her eyes
and a mysterious smile upon her lips. “But,
<i>mamon</i>,” protested Jean, “what is this? Why
this hysterical manner? Has anything happened?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>“Anything? <i>Ciel!</i> he calls it anything,
nothing to have been reported missing. He
thinks me an insensate who did not mourn over
him as one lost, dead, prisoner.”</p>

<p>“But I was never any of those things,” declared
Jean. “I was in the fight, yes, but
luckily I have not even a scratch. I was gassed
a little, yes, and I have this <i>permission</i> to make
up for it.”</p>

<p>But even this assurance did not stop the flow
of Paulette’s tears, and she still clung to him
while he patted her encouragingly, his eyes on
Odette.</p>

<p>“It has been a long time that she has kept
back her tears,” explained Odette. “When she
believed the worst she was brave, oh very full of
courage. Now, you see, it is the relief which
brings the tears.”</p>

<p>Paulette wiped her eyes and allowed herself
to be led to a chair. “It was all because of that
child,” she said. “I accepted the report and
believed I had lost you. Did she? Not at all.
‘It is not true,’ she said. ‘I shall not believe it
till we have the proof.’ It is she who has kept
me in heart, for not once would she believe it.”</p>

<p>“Why did you of all others refuse to believe
it?” asked Jean, looking at Odette.</p>

<p>“I do not know,” the girl returned. “Why
should one believe an unhappy thing till one is
obliged to?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>Jean nodded thoughtfully. “It is good philosophy,”
he returned. “Why I was reported
missing I do not know, but yes, I think I do, for
there is a Jean Ribaud who was taken prisoner.
The names sound the same, you see.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry for that other poor Jean,” said
Odette.</p>

<p>“As you would have been sorry for me?
Probably he had no Nenette and Rintintin to
protect him.”</p>

<p>A flashing smile lighted up Odette’s face as she
picked up a bucket to go for water.</p>

<p>Jean looked at his mother who had now quite
recovered her calm, and who rose, upon hospitality
intent, and went into the little kitchen. Then
Jean’s eyes turned toward Odette’s vanishing
form. It was Odette whom he followed. The
smile which dawned upon Paulette’s face ended
in a little chuckle.</p>

<p>Three days later Jean was back with his
<i>copains</i>. The evening he took his departure
Paulette and Odette knelt side by side for a long
time in the dusk of the little church.</p>

<p>The next news was that Italy, who had already
broken with Austria-Hungary, had declared war
on Germany. The battle of the Somme continued.
Roumania, siding with the Allies, entered
the war only to be utterly crushed. The
end of the war appeared further off than ever.</p>

<p>The old joyous days seemed over for both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
Lucie and Annette. Tragedy was too near them.
What was the outcome for France? Madame
Guerin’s face grew grimmer and sharper. Madame
Le Brun became more feeble. The days
of fatness were over. So many things were
scarce. Poor little Madame Le Brun fretted
at the short rations, especially she missed sugar.
“Of course,” she said, she was willing to make
sacrifices for the soldiers, for her country, but why
sugar?</p>

<p>“You are so childish, Marcelline,” said her
sister. “Look at Lucie and Annette; they
never make a complaint, and surely girls like
sugar as well as you do.”</p>

<p>“They can eat anything, which I cannot do,”
returned Madame Le Brun plaintively.</p>

<p>“I am sure, grandma, I am perfectly willing
to give up anything but bare necessities, if it will
do Gaspard any good,” said Annette.</p>

<p>“Well, but I have no Gaspard,” returned her
grandmother with some asperity. “If I were
young and romantic I might feel differently.”</p>

<p>“Poor grandmother,” said Annette to Lucie
when they were alone, “I wish I had a ration of
sugar to give her, for I do not mind in the least
going without.”</p>

<p>“Nor I. If it does my father any good, I am
willing to live on the very plainest fare.”</p>

<p>“I think we all feel that way, all except poor
grandmother. She has been so accustomed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
being considered and catered to that it is harder
for her than most.”</p>

<p>“I think perhaps,” said Lucie after a pause,
“that one should be thankful for opportunities of
making sacrifices, for it certainly makes us
stronger and more unselfish. I used to hate
sorrow and trouble but now I can see the use of
it, even though I do not enjoy it.”</p>

<p>Annette smiled. “I don’t believe there is
even a saint who would expect us to enjoy
trouble,” she answered. “We can accept it as
a part of discipline, as Sister Marie Ottillia used
to say, but we needn’t try to delight in it.” The
two girls went on with their sewing very quietly
for a while. “I haven’t heard from Gaspard for
a long time,” Annette at last spoke her thought.
“I don’t know whether that means good or bad
news.”</p>

<p>“Odette would say good news,” responded
Lucie. “She is an odd little one, that Odette.
If she had lived in the days of Joan of Arc I
believe that she too might have heard voices.”</p>

<p>“How Paulette dotes on her, and no wonder.
Have you ever thought—?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I have thought, but I do not say
anything. One must wait till the war is over.”</p>

<p>“Must one? I shall not if Gaspard decides
otherwise.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps that is why you have had no letters.
He may be on his way home.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>“I have thought of that.”</p>

<p>“And it is why you are sewing so contentedly
and are putting in so many fine stitches?”</p>

<p>“It is one reason.”</p>

<p>Lucie drew a little sigh. “It will be strange to
think of you married, Annette. Here we are
seeing each other daily just as we did before
the war, and the time will come when you will
be in one place and I in another.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not. We might both continue to be
here.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, for as soon as we dare we must go
back to have the home all ready for my mother.”</p>

<p>Annette was silent. She felt very uncertain
that Lucie’s hopes were to be fulfilled. Then
she briskly changed the subject. “Would you
embroider this all the way around, or would you
only put a little in front?”</p>

<p>Lucie gave the matter due consideration, but
had not decided when there came a call from
below stairs. “Annette, Annette. Come at
once.”</p>

<p>Down went Annette’s work as she hastily ran
to answer the call. Although Lucie was full of
curiosity she decided that she would not follow.
If she had been wanted the call would have included
herself. So she sat quite still, presently
looking around to see if Pom Pom were near.
He could be relied upon not to be very far off,
and this time was discovered under Lucie’s chair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>Annette was gone a long time, so that Lucie
began to wonder what was keeping her and was
about to go in search of her when her friend
appeared, looking very flushed and excited.
“It is so strange, so very strange,” she began,
“just as we were talking of it.”</p>

<p>“Not trouble!” exclaimed Lucie, “not more
trouble.”</p>

<p>“No, I hope not.” A little smile flitted across
Annette’s face. “It is about Gaspard. He is
coming, and—”</p>

<p>“And—.” Lucie looked her understanding.</p>

<p>“Yes, that is it. He wishes that we be married
at once so that I can go back with him to Paris
and spend the rest of his leave with him there.
He has affairs to look after in Paris, you see, and
cannot stay here for long.”</p>

<p>“And what is this at once?” asked Lucie,
suddenly feeling very much grown up.</p>

<p>“Day after to-morrow,” replied Annette
soberly. “He has six weeks leave, which gives
him about a month in Paris.”</p>

<p>“And then you will come back here?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, to wait till the war is over and he
returns to take up his life here at <i>Coin-du-Pres</i>,
which will be my home forevermore, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“You like the idea? You would rather that
than to go back to your old home next door to us?”</p>

<p>Annette shook her head. “That old home is
no more. From what we have heard there is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
little to go back to. One must accept such
things and be content.”</p>

<p>Lucie sighed. “I shall never be content till
I get back there, even if there be not a tree nor
a shrub left. It has been very wonderful that
I could be with you here, and particularly now,
but I could not stay during that forevermore, for
I shall some day have my own home with my own
parents, you see. It would be very queer, however,
if I were not on hand to see you married.
You are eighteen, and in another year I shall
be that age, but it seems to me that it will be a
long, a very long time before I shall be thinking
of marriage. Just consider, Annette, it is
probable that I have never seen the man I shall
marry. I wonder what he is like. Perhaps I
shall never marry at all. It is very likely to be
that way, and I shall be perfectly satisfied, for
with my father and mother whom else should I
wish? unless it be my friend, Madame Gaspard
Guerin. How funny that sounds.”</p>

<p>Annette, who had picked up her work again
and was setting swift stitches, smiled as she
repeated the name softly.</p>

<p>“It may not sound so strange to you,” Lucie
chattered on, “for the name has always been
familiar, but consider, Annette, what it may mean
to me to have a perfectly strange name suddenly
thrust upon me.”</p>

<p>Annette let her eyes rest for a moment upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
her friend. “It may not be a strange name,” she
remarked.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, it will have to be, for I have not yet
met the man that I mean to fall in love with.”</p>

<p>Annette tipped her head to one side and regarded
Lucie reflectively. “You say funny
things,” she asserted, “but all the same I repeat
that it may not be an unfamiliar name; one never
knows. Do you like the name of Guerin?” she
asked after a pause.</p>

<p>“It is a very good name. I do not dislike it.”</p>

<p>“Which do you like better, the name of Gaspard
or Victor?”</p>

<p>“Why, I don’t know. I never thought. I
believe Victor—no, Gaspard. It is less common,
although Victor sounds well, as if the owner
might really be a victor.”</p>

<p>“Which I hope our Victor will be. You are
going to be my bridesmaid of course, Lucie.”</p>

<p>“In refugee clothes?”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! This is a war wedding and it
doesn’t matter what one wears. If my grandmother
had not treasured her own wedding frock
and had not insisted upon bringing it away
rather than more sensible things, I should be
without a proper gown myself. It will have to
be altered a little, but Aunt Clothilde knows
some one who will do that to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“And I shall have no wedding present for
you,” Lucie went on sadly, “unless,” she added<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
with a little laugh, “I can find you a volume
of Dickens.”</p>

<p>Annette laughed, too. “How long ago that
seems, and what children we were.”</p>

<p>“Three years is a long, long time. A month
is a long time and you will be away for that long.
I wonder what will happen before you get
back?”</p>

<p>“Let us hope the war will end,” returned
Annette, shaking out her sewing as she rose to
put it away.</p>

<p>Gaspard arrived the next day and with him a
young officer who was to be best man. His
cousin had tried to get hold of Victor, but finding
this an impossibility had pressed this comrade
into service. Lucie looked speculatively at the
young man, whose name was Adolph Favre, but
made up her mind before very long that he was
not the hero of her dreams, well meaning and
courteous though he was, and quite inclined to
pay especial compliments to her.</p>

<p>Because of the short notice everything was in
a great flurry, of course. Madame Guerin was
everywhere, directing, scolding, arranging. Madame
Le Brun was divided between encouraging
a headache and a desire to see all that was going
on. Mons. Le Brun frowned one minute and
smiled the next. He was fond of his little granddaughter
and this marrying her to a soldier in
war time involved some anxiety as to her future.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
He and Lucie had long talks whenever they found
a chance, which was not often. Paulette, summoned
from the fields with Odette, was turned
into the kitchen to give her very capable assistance
in the preparation of the feast. Michel was
kept running errands here, there, everywhere,
while Jules with the <i>charrette</i> was jogging into the
village nearly every hour.</p>

<p>At last Annette in her grandmother’s ivory
satin wedding gown was ready. Lucie in a
simple white voilé attended her. The roses
Annette carried were from the garden of <i>Coin-du-Pres</i>.
The little bride looked very young
and innocent. There was not a large wedding
party but the small church was filled with the
villagers, scarce a young man, but many old
ones, were there, the doctor chief among them.
Every one tried to be merry at the wedding
breakfast but somehow merriment did not sit
well; the times were too uncertain, so they
finally lapsed into quiet talk, Gaspard and his
friends ready to tell of thrilling adventures,
which kept the others spellbound until the hour
of departure was at hand.</p>

<p>It was Lucie and Odette who divested Annette
of her bridal robes and got her into the simple
traveling dress which she was to wear. Annette
cried a little as she said good-by, but went off
quite proud of her soldier husband, and of being
called Madame.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>Lucie begged to go into the kitchen to help
Paulette and Odette to clear up. “It will be less
lonely there,” she argued, so Madame Guerin
gave permission, and in the drying of fine glass
and china, the counting of silver, she passed
away the first hours, chattering away to Odette
about the events of the day. “She looked very
sweet, didn’t she, Odette?” she began. “But
so young, like a little girl. Gaspard appeared so
much older. I hope he is not too old.”</p>

<p>Paulette laughed. “How old might this antiquity
be?” she asked.</p>

<p>“He is three years older than Victor and Victor
was eighteen just after the war began. That is
three years ago or nearly so, therefore Victor is
twenty-one and Gaspard twenty-four, six years
older than Annette. In another year he will be
twenty-five, which is far from young.”</p>

<p>Paulette laughed again. “Far from young is
it? <i>Ma foi</i>, mademoiselle, what is one at forty?”</p>

<p>“He would be far too old for me to consider
for a husband,” replied Lucie diplomatically.</p>

<p>“La la, there is time enough for you to be
thinking of that.”</p>

<p>“But when one’s oldest friend has just married
one cannot but think somewhat on the subject.
I looked forward to meeting this Mons. Favre.
Perhaps he is the one, I told myself, but after I
saw him I decided he would never do.”</p>

<p>“It is not for little girls to be looking out for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
husbands,” said Paulette severely. “It is quite
out of place. You should leave it to your
parents.”</p>

<p>“I don’t intend to leave it to them altogether.
I intend to have my say in the matter,” returned
Lucie decidedly.</p>

<p>Paulette threw out her hands with a hopeless
gesture. “This comes of having no proper
guardian. If we hear any more of these too
independent opinions, monsieur your father
must be spoken to. You should be in a convent
this minute.”</p>

<p>This was the most crushing speech Paulette
had ever made to her and Lucie was properly
subdued. She laid down the towel she held and
marched out of the room, determining to hunt

<small>THE RETURN</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN Lucie watched the fluttering ends of
Annette’s blue veil disappearing around
the corner of the road as she drove away, Lucie
little knew that it was the last she should see of
her friend for many weeks. It was early spring.
The United States had already severed diplomatic
relations with Germany and every one was
wondering what would happen next. Things
were going badly in Russia, but Bagdad had been
taken by the British, and the middle of March
saw the evacuation by the Germans of French
territory from Arras to Soissons.</p>

<p>It was the old doctor who brought the news
that the United States had declared war upon
Germany. He came driving up in his old
cabriolet, and shouting “<i>Vive la France! Vive
les Américains!</i>”</p>

<p>Lucie went out to greet him. “What is this?
What is this?” she cried.</p>

<p>“<i>Bon jour. Mlle. Demi-Américaine</i>,” said the
doctor. “One half of you should be extra proud
this day.”</p>

<p>“Oh, why? why?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>“Because your mother’s countrymen have
specifically declared war upon Germany. We
have always known they were with us in spirit,
but now we have this resounding fact. Soon,
soon you will see the Stars and Stripes, at the
head of American regiments who will be marching
with our men. Paris has gone mad with joy.
We have always known that we must win one
day, but this brings the good day that much
nearer.”</p>

<p>Lucie clasped her hands in delight. “The half
of me that is American is very proud and glad,”
she said, “and the other half is glad, too, not that
those brave Americans must suffer, must die, but
that their coming brings the end that much
nearer.”</p>

<p>“Where is my good friend Antoine Le Brun
this morning?” asked the doctor, leading his old
white horse around to a hitching post.</p>

<p>“I will find him,” Lucie offered, and ran into
the house calling: “Where are you, Grandpa
Le Brun? The Americans are coming! The
Americans are coming! The doctor has brought
this good news.” She ran from room to room
with her announcement, and after coming upon
Mons. Le Brun at the back of the house, she sent
him to join the doctor while she scurried down
to Paulette whose spring work in the fields had
begun.</p>

<p>She found her in violent altercation with old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
Jules, for these two seldom missed a chance for
argument, out of which, it must be confessed,
Paulette usually emerged with flying colors.
“Such news! Such news!” cried Lucie as she
came within hearing. “The Americans are with
us. Their troops will be with us immediately.”</p>

<p>“Aha, my fine sir!” exclaimed Paulette, standing
with arms akimbo and shaking her head.
“What did I tell you?”</p>

<p>“Zut! I don’t believe a word of it. That is all
talk. They will never come. Mark my words.”
Jules wagged a skinny and earth-stained forefinger
under Paulette’s nose.</p>

<p>“But it is true, I assure you,” persisted Lucie.
“The doctor has just brought the news which he
says is an absolute fact.”</p>

<p>“Well, let it be a fact,” responded Jules.
“Admit that they will come. What are they?
Raw, untrained savages. It will take months if
not years to get them into any sort of shape.
This hue and cry of ‘the Americans are coming!’
sounds very well to those who are easily fooled,
but I, for one, am too wise a bird to be caught
with such chaff.”</p>

<p>“A bird indeed,” scoffed Paulette contemptuously;
“one of the variety that hisses in the
barnyard and whose chief use is to supply
feathers for beds.” She turned on her heel,
leaving Jules stuttering with rage, and uttering
epithets more forcible than polite.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>“He is an imbecile, that,” remarked Paulette
as she walked away to another part of the field.
“I am getting very tired of him. These Americans,
when do they come, and how soon will they
rid the land of those Boches?”</p>

<p>“I suppose one cannot tell, but the doctor
evidently believes it will be soon. I have heard
him say that the moral effect upon the exhausted
armies would be as great as the physical. He has
been talking much of the Americans coming in
and has put great faith upon them.”</p>

<p>“Then I suppose one may begin to think of
returning home.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Paulette, do you really mean it?”</p>

<p>“Why not. Have I ever decided to remain
here for the rest of my life? Not at all. It is
well enough, this, but where I was born is better,
and it is where I should choose to die.”</p>

<p>“But they say there is nothing there. What
shall we do to go back to mere handfuls of earth,
holes in the ground?”</p>

<p>“There will be more than that, I fancy.
There has been destruction, of course, but I have
asked and I am told that our little town has not
been so hardly dealt with as some others.”</p>

<p>“If you go, then I go, too.”</p>

<p>“You will be better off here, more comfortable.”</p>

<p>“I do not care for that. I want to be there to
help resurrect our home and be on the spot when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
my mother comes. She will come, Paulette,
she will, she will. Odette believes it and what
Odette believes generally happens.”</p>

<p>Paulette struck her hoe into the brown mold
several times before she answered with a little
twist of a smile: “Even Odette may not be
counted upon as infallible.”</p>

<p>“But you admit she is generally right.”</p>

<p>“Generally, yes, generally, but not always.”</p>

<p>Lucie pondered on this truth rather mournfully,
before she said, with a sigh: “If one must
lose faith, Paulette, one may as well give up and
die.”</p>

<p>“Very true, <i>chérie</i>. Keep your faith. I only
wish to prepare you for the worst if it should
come.”</p>

<p>Lucie shook her head. “No, I shall continue
to follow Odette’s philosophy. One can never be
prepared for the worst. If it comes, it is no
harder a blow than if one expected it; if it does
not come, one will then not have wasted time in
grieving.”</p>

<p>She turned away and went back to the house to
learn that another piece of news had come with
the morning’s mail: Annette was going on to
Marseilles with her husband, and would stay
with him there until he should receive orders.
He might be sent to Italy instead of to Turkey.</p>

<p>Close upon this news came a letter from Miss
Lowndes to Lucie. The two had kept up a correspondence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
all this time, but this letter was of
special interest, since it told of a certain undertaking
in which Miss Lowndes would take part.
“We are trying to restore the evacuated towns
in the devastated areas,” she wrote, “and I am
hoping that I will be sent to your native place.
We hear that it is not so badly wrecked as
some, and that some of the people have stayed
on. We shall do our best to make these comfortable
and the others too who are fast returning.”</p>

<p>Lucie lost no time in running out to Paulette
with this letter. She was so out of breath and
read so fast that Paulette was bewildered.
“Stop, stop, my little one,” she cried. “I cannot
keep up with this. Begin over again.”</p>

<p>Lucie began reading more slowly, Paulette
making queer muttered exclamations as she
continued. At the end the good woman wiped
her eyes, then clasped her hands and cast a look
heavenward. “At last,” she murmured. “<i>Le
bon Dieu</i> restores us at last. <i>Eh bien</i>, my child,
I am ready.”</p>

<p>“What shall we do first, Paulette, what shall
we do?”</p>

<p>Paulette considered. “We write two letters,
one to your father, one to the American young
lady. We ask your father if he will permit that
you accompany me and Odette back to the home.
We ask the young lady when she departs and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
where we may join her. Then we wait for
replies.”</p>

<p>“Excellent, Paulette. How much good sense
you have. I will write these letters immediately,
and get them off as soon as possible. In the
meantime I will talk to Grandpa Le Brun and he
will tell the others.” She started off, then came
running back to ask: “Paulette, what about the
money? Shall we have any to begin on?”</p>

<p>“I have all the wages I have earned here, or
nearly all. Odette has hers, and then there is
my allotment.” Paulette always talked very
grandly of her allotment, but considering that
the pay of a common soldier was but a sou
a day, one can estimate that the amount paid
her as mother of a <i>poilu</i> could not be very
munificent.</p>

<p>“I have my allotment, too,” Lucie made the
statement, “and of course papa will contribute
what he can, just as he pays for my board here.
We shall do very well, I believe.”</p>

<p>She went off to write her letters, and it may be
stated that she left out no argument in pleading
her cause. Then she took her confidence to
Mons. Le Brun.</p>

<p>He looked quite aghast when she laid the plan
before him. “But, my dear child,” he exclaimed,
“this will never do in the world. The place is
not yet safe. It is in a condition most wretched,
most pathetic. The discomforts will be intolerable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
for you. Why not consent to remain
with us until the war is over, and then if you
must go back wait till things are in better condition?”</p>

<p>But Lucie was deaf to all these arguments.
“It will have to depend altogether upon what my
father says,” she maintained. “As for me I am
as able as Mlle. Lowndes or any one to endure
privations. If she, an American, can do this for
France must I be deprived of what is plainly a
duty?” So it was left to hear what Captain
Du Bois would say, and Lucie possessed her soul
in patience.</p>

<p>She had rather a long time to wait, but the
answers came in course of time. First one from
her father. He appreciated her feelings in the
matter. He had been in communication with
Miss Lowndes and had learned that she had
asked to be sent to the town which had been,
formerly, their home. There would be much to
do, and she would be only too glad of helpers, and
therefore if Lucie felt it her duty to go, there
should be no restriction upon her act. She
would best meet Miss Lowndes in Paris and
place herself under her care.</p>

<p>Lucie showed the letter triumphantly to Mons.
Le Brun. He read it, shook his head doubtfully,
but made no further comment than “<i>Eh bien</i>,
you go.” A little later he took to pacing the
floor, stopped abruptly and exclaimed passionately:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
“I would to heaven I were going, too,
but my wife would perish among such scenes.
There is nothing to do but remain. We are too
old to begin life over again in want and discomfort.”</p>

<p>Next came the letter from Miss Lowndes.
She was enthusiastic. It would be wonderful
to have Lucie as a companion, and that dear
good Paulette who was a host in herself. They
might have privations, probably would, but they
would not starve, and it was a splendid work.
A few of the better class of refugees were ready to
return, though not many. The old <i>curé</i> was
eager to head the returning company. They
would start the last of the month.</p>

<p>Then there came a day when the basket which
Paulette had so hurriedly packed for their flight
was repacked for the return with the same
utensils carefully hoarded all this time. “We
shall need them,” remarked Paulette. The
array of bundles and crates far exceeded that
with which they had started forth from home, for
contributions came from every quarter. The
pair of chickens which Paulette had slung in
their decapitated condition from her waist was
increased to two pairs of live ones donated by
Madame Guerin. A pair of rabbits, too, was
offered as well as a couple of pigeons. Add to
this menagerie Pom Pom, and the confusion of
sounds may be imagined, though to the rabbits<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
one cannot impute much of a racket. From
none of these things would Paulette be parted.
How she managed to dispose of them so that
they would not interfere with one another is a
puzzle, but manage she did. Lucie, of course,
carried Pom Pom. Such acquisitions as Paulette
would yield up to her Odette took in charge.
Whatever was impossible of being transported
by hand was sent on. With the prospect of
Paulette’s disappearance from his path Jules
ceased to be grouchy and these two parted with
many polite expressions of mutual good-will.
Michel was almost in tears, the housemaids wept
openly. Mons. Le Brun slipped an envelope
into Lucie’s hand, “For some one who may need
it,” he whispered. Later on Lucie discovered
the fifty franc note within.</p>

<p>“<i>Au ’voir! Au ’voir!</i>” followed them till they
turned the corner of the road by the Calvary
and the white house of <i>Coin-du-Pres</i> was lost to
view. It had been truly a haven of refuge, and
Lucie trembled a little as she realized that again
she was launching out upon the wide sea of uncertainty.</p>

<p>At the station in Paris there was Miss Lowndes
to meet them, looking a little older, a little thinner,
but as bright and cheerful as ever. At sight
of Paulette’s accumulations she was rather staggered
for a moment, but she had seen too many
refugees to be long nonplussed, and in an incredibly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
short space of time she had found a man
with a handcart into which everything was bundled
but the livestock from which Paulette absolutely
refused to be parted.</p>

<p>Paris in June was a more attractive place than
Paris in November, and Lucie was not sorry
to be there. Her satisfaction increased, however,
to real enthusiasm when Miss Lowndes told her
that the first American troops had already
landed and were expected in Paris the next
day.</p>

<p>“And we shall see them, Lucie, we shall see
them,” Miss Lowndes said to her. “I am
so glad that we do not leave before that. I
could not have stood it.”</p>

<p>“And we shall see them, Paulette and Odette,
too?”</p>

<p>“Surely.”</p>

<p>“How wonderful, how wonderful! It may be
that some of my own kin will be among them,
although I have no means of finding out. I like
to think it, however. Shall you have friends
among them?”</p>

<p>“I think so and I shall look out for them,
though I shall be so excited I doubt if I can
distinguish any one.”</p>

<p>It took some diplomacy for Miss Lowndes to
house these newcomers properly. Lucie she
bore off to her own boarding house, Paulette and
Odette were lodged near by with one Hortense<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
Morand who kept the bakery from which Miss
Lowndes’ rolls were served, and who, considering
that it was for an exile, was willing to take in
not only these two lodgers but the hens, the
rabbits and the pigeons.</p>

<p>But if it was difficult to find lodgings for the
little party, so much the more was it so to find a
vantage point from which they could view the
newly arrived troops. All Paris was agog. The
streets were crowded, flags were flying, bands
were playing. “I suppose there is nothing for
us but to mix with the common herd,” declared
Miss Lowndes, “and stand on the sidewalk.
After all there might be a worse place, for we shall
be nearer to the boys than higher up. Here,
Lucie, pin on this little American flag. You, too,
Paulette, and you, Odette. I think I can make
myself known as an American and perhaps
we shall receive some consideration in being
given room.”</p>

<p>This proved not a bad idea, for they were
allowed the edge of a curbstone when Miss
Lowndes betrayed her nationality by her speech.
They stood patiently for a long time, but at last
the cheers began away down the street, growing
nearer and nearer. There was enthusiasm
enough for their own brave fellows, but when the
tall, gaunt, clear-eyed young Americans came
marching by, the crowd went wild. They
cheered, they wept, they babbled fond blessings.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
They strewed flowers, they thrust gifts of chocolate
into the hands of the smiling lads. They
danced to the tune of Dixie; they laughed and
kept time with the catchy ragtime music of the
bands. The city was taken by storm, for these
boys represented not only young America, but
the inspirers of a new courage which should lead
the way to peace.</p>

<p>Nora Lowndes forgot who she was, where she
was, what she was. She was conscious only
that these were her countrymen who had come
for righteousness’ sake to give their best to
France. “Bless every one of you,” she called
out, and they, noting the familiar speech, cast
smiling glances at her out of the corners of their
eyes.</p>

<p>“It was worth waiting for,” sighed Miss
Lowndes when the last man had passed. “I
am sure I must have known some of them, but I
was too dazed to tell. It is a great thing to
leave Paris with such a memory as that.”</p>

<p>“I shall remember it forever,” Lucie answered.
“I was never so proud of my mother’s country
as I am to-day.”</p>

<p>This was the first sight they had of the khaki-clad
youths, but it was far from being the last,
for in that region to which they were going they
were soon to become a familiar sight.</p>

<p>The next day they set out. An older lady
joined them. Then two men, French, one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
American, took them in a motor car which had
been designated for this service. More and more
desolate the scene became as they advanced.
Where had been smiling hamlets were only
shattered walls, great shell holes, utter waste.
As they went on toward abandoned districts,
now evacuated by the enemy, there were more
signs of life. The kindly green of grass covered
silent places. Birds were singing, wild flowers
blooming, but everywhere, everywhere were the
rows of little crosses which marked the graves of
those who no longer heard the birds or saw the
flowers blooming above them.</p>

<p>It was a wearisome journey, for the way was
difficult over the roughest of roads. The car
was loaded to its fullest capacity for there were
many necessities which they must take with
them. More would follow as their plans developed.
Long before they reached their destination
silence had fallen upon the whole group,
the silence of fatigue.</p>

<p>At last the car stopped. “This is the place,
madam,” said the American driver to Mrs.
Graves.</p>

<p>Lucie sprang to her feet and looked eagerly
around. It looked strangely unfamiliar. There
was the main street with the semblance of some
of the houses still standing. The factory chimneys
had disappeared. The church tower also.
From a few of the houses arose a feeble wisp of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
smoke. Where were the trees, the gardens?
From some forgotten corner a single rosebush
reared its head to cast the fragrance of its
blossoms upon the mild June air.</p>

<p>“Do you think you could locate your house,
Lucie?” asked Miss Lowndes in a troubled voice.</p>

<p>Lucie alighted from the car and looked up and
down the street. Finally she discovered the
walls of the church, which were in fair condition.</p>

<p>“It should be over there,” she said at last, a
little frown puckering her brow, “not very far
beyond the church.”</p>

<p>“Drive that way slowly, Marcus, if you
please,” said Mrs. Graves.</p>

<p>Slowly the car made its way up the street,
both Lucie and Paulette keeping a sharp lookout.
Paulette was the first to speak. “There it is,”
she announced. “I see the little shed where we
kept Ninette. It is still standing. The Le
Bruns’ house is gone utterly, but the garden wall
is standing there.”</p>

<p>“And some of our house,” put in Lucie eagerly.
“One corner is quite destroyed, but I can recognize
what is left.”</p>

<p>They left the car and began to examine the
premises. The gardens of the two houses were
choked with débris from the fallen buildings.
The old cherry tree was nothing but a stump.
They made their way over the piles of stone,
brick and plaster. The house was an empty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
shell. Only the little shed was quite intact.
“We can begin to live here,” remarked Paulette
firmly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Graves looked dubiously at Miss
Lowndes. “The other end of the town seems
to be in better condition,” she remarked.
“Perhaps we’d better go there.”</p>

<p>“You can go there, and I should advise you
to,” said Paulette, “but for me I stay here.”</p>

<p>“And I too,” declared Odette.</p>

<p>Lucie caught Miss Lowndes’ hand. “Please
don’t say I must leave them,” she cried.</p>

<p>“But, my dear, I am afraid you cannot be
comfortable. Why not come with us? There
seem to be several quite good houses left and I
am sure we can find a better place to stay to-night.
To-morrow we can see what we can do
here.”</p>

<p>“But you don’t understand,” said Lucie
agitatedly. “It is my home, my home. For
three years, nearly, I have longed for it.”</p>

<p>“My dear, my dear, I do understand. Suppose
we examine the shed and see what it looks
like.”</p>

<p>They struggled over the stones to reach it to
find it the one thing unchanged. Evidently
it had not been used. The winds of winter had
swept through it, the rains of spring had fallen
upon it, but had not harmed it. Inside it was
dry, warm, and if not quite clean, at least it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
not so foul a place as that cow shed Lucie remembered.</p>

<p>Mrs. Graves and Miss Lowndes regarded it
critically, then they exchanged glances. “You
may bring in the cots, Marcus,” said Mrs. Graves.</p>

<p>In half an hour the shed was swept out, the
cots set up, the bedding provided. Then,
leaving the little family to do what they would,
the two American ladies started out to find
quarters for themselves.</p>

<p>After a little supper in the open Lucie went to
explore, leaving Paulette to house her live
stock. Pom Pom, in puzzled curiosity, went
nosing all over the place. Lucie found the steps
of the house and mounted them. The door was
shivered to bits. She crept within the walls,
avoiding bits of glass, slivers of wood, picking her
way from spot to spot, trying to discover some
token of what had been hers.</p>

<p>She was gone so long that Odette and Paulette
went to look for her. They found her sitting
on the topmost step, her head buried in her arm.
She was sobbing her heart out, for the fragment
of stuff which she clutched in her hand was a bit
of the very dress her mother had worn the
morning before she went away.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br>

<small>THE OLD FOLKS AT HOME</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THERE was more of the town undisturbed
than at first was apparent. To be sure the
houses so left had been looted and everything
of value carried off, but it was astonishing how
soon Mrs. Graves and Miss Lowndes were able
to make themselves comfortable with what was
left and with what they were able to send for,
yet it was very far from luxury at the best,
and in great contrast to what they were accustomed
to in their own homes. Refugees
came creeping slowly back to be reëstablished
as soon as possible. Many had been living in
the cellars under the factories during the time
of bombardment and afterward when the Germans
were in possession. They did not complain
of much ill treatment, but were underfed
and sickly, telling many tragic tales of petty
tyrannies and of the deportation of all the able-bodied
persons in the town, as well as of the
destruction of all the fine machines in the
factories.</p>

<p>At their end of the town Paulette, Odette and
Lucie worked feverishly. They were sure of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
food and shelter; the rest did not matter. Their
energies were bent upon restoring the home so
far as possible. First the débris around the
shed was cleared to give them free exit and
entrance, then the free space was enlarged by
degrees. It was not easy to get helpers, for
all were occupied in restoring their own, yet
Miss Lowndes more than once came to the
rescue by sending young Marcus, who loaded
up his sturdy machine and carried off a lot of
stuff in order that garden space might be had.
Nothing could be done with the house at present,
but it was found possible to enlarge the shed,
construct some rough furniture and install a
small stove. As all three lived mostly out-of-doors,
they considered themselves not badly
housed. By degrees shell holes in the garden
were filled up, the earth uncovered and a late
garden planted. It was a red-letter day when
Lucie discovered that the cherry tree was sending
up shoots from its roots and that there
were some pale, greeny white sprouts around the
grape vines which had been uncovered.</p>

<p>But the biggest surprise of all occurred one
morning when she went out and saw sitting on
a section of the wall, serenely washing his face,
who, but Mousse! For an instant Lucie stared,
scarcely believing her eyes. “It couldn’t really
be,” she whispered to herself. “It must be
some other cat like him.” Then she called:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
“Mousse, Mousse!” The cat paused in his
ablutions, regarding her with a wary eye. She
went nearer. The cat ran along the wall a
little way, then sat down again to continue his
morning toilet. Lucie watched him for a few
moments, but fearing to drive him away did not
move nearer. Presently she went cautiously
to the shed where Paulette was getting breakfast.
“Paulette, come out here,” she said;
“I am sure that Mousse has returned.”</p>

<p>Paulette smiled. “But that is impossible.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why. Come and see for yourself.”</p>

<p>“If it be Mousse he had a peculiar mark on
one of his hind legs,” said Paulette. “Odette,
watch the pot while I go to convince this imaginative
child.”</p>

<p>They went out again, Pom Pom following
closely at their heels. At sight of the cat Pom
Pom gave one quick, sudden bark, but stopped
short and with wagging tail approached the wall.
With clasped hands Lucie watched the two creatures
breathlessly. The cat on the wall did not
stir, but gazed down with a blandly tolerant expression
at the little dog. Pom Pom began to
whine. The cat got up, stretched himself, exhibiting
a diagonal line of white across one of his
hind legs, and took a position where he could
better observe the dog.</p>

<p>“You are right; it is Mousse,” declared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
Paulette, “and those two have not forgotten
each other.” She began to call in a high shrill
key as she was accustomed to do in the old days,
and found her way slowly along the wall to the
place where he sat. The cat did not budge as
she drew nearer and nearer making beguiling
sounds of invitation; he put his ears forward,
listened for a moment, then walked along the
wall toward her and jumped down upon her
shoulder in his old manner of doing. He did
not stay there, however, but leaped to the
ground, and stood with bristling tail to face
Pom Pom. The dog, however, not in the least
disconcerted, kept his guard smiling, if a dog
can be said to smile, and insinuatingly wagging
his tail. Mousse stood his ground for a moment,
fixing Pom Pom with a glittering eye, then his
tail began to resume its normal size. He walked
up to Pom Pom, the two touched noses and
walked off amicably toward the shed. Pom Pom
leading the way.</p>

<p>Paulette with hands on her hips laughed long
and loudly. “That is a sight I never expected
to see,” she declared, “and one I wouldn’t have
missed.”</p>

<p>“Where do you suppose Mousse has lived all
this time, and how has he found food?” said
Lucie.</p>

<p>“There are plenty of rats and mice to be had
for the hunting,” Paulette answered, “and it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
not impossible that the Boches themselves have
given him a bite now and then, though the
wonder is they did not carry him away.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps there wasn’t time. He might have
had the good sense to hide,” returned Lucie.
“Well, Paulette, we are bound to have surprises.
I wonder what the next one will be.”</p>

<p>“Let us hope it will be as pleasant as this,”
responded Paulette, opening the door before
which both cat and dog were standing. “That
Mousse must be given food the first thing,
though we have none to spare.”</p>

<p>“He shall have half my breakfast,” Lucie
promised. But this Paulette would not allow,
though Mousse was not to be permitted to go
hungry, as a contribution from each one was
given him.</p>

<p>“I doubt if he stays, after all,” said Paulette.
And he did not at first, though by degrees he
spent more and more time with his old friends,
accepting Pom Pom with much better grace
than in the days of his frisky youth. Possibly
it was a case of “Absence makes the heart grow
fonder.”</p>

<p>In course of time Paulette and Odette had a
garden to work in. <i>Les Dames Américaines</i>,
as they were called, enlarged their work so
that in the neighborhood were established little
farms where the people could raise their own
food and where those soldiers no longer able to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
be of service at the front could find employment.
Dispensaries and hospitals were likewise
established, schools, too, and the discouraged
people were given food, clothing, and medicines.</p>

<p>After other matters had been given the attention
so sorely needed, a canteen was started
where passing troops could be fed. On busy
days Lucie was often summoned to help. It
was after one of these days of rush and excitement
that she was coming home and was startled
at hearing a lusty but mellow voice singing:
“Way down upon the Swanee river.” She
stood stock-still waiting for the man to come
up. What memories the old song brought.
She must see who this was, an American, of
course, for many had passed that way in the
course of the past twenty-four hours. She
waited till the khaki-clad figure was within
speaking distance, then she saw that he was as
black as the ace of spades, and that he bore a
bandaged head. At last she was beholding
one of those negroes of which her mother had so
often told her. She would speak to him.</p>

<p>“Were you looking for the canteen?” she
asked.</p>

<p>The man looked at her then burst into a cheerful
guffaw. “Deed, miss, dat sho is perzackly
what I is a lookin’ fo’,” he replied. “I done
axed severial pussons but somehow dey doesn’t
unnerstan’ my desires, an’ I ain’t ketched on to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
dis yere Frenchified langwidges yit. It sho
does son’ good to me to yer ole United States.”</p>

<p>Lucie had some difficulty in taking in this
speech herself, but it was clear that he wanted
the canteen, and she decided to show him the
way. “I think I’d better go with you,” she
said. “Were you wounded?”</p>

<p>“Yas, miss, but not to say so bad, jes a little
tech o’ shrapnel in de haid, but hit kep me at de
dressin’ station an’ I kinder los’ sight o’ de res’
o’ de boys, so I pikes along de road by mahsef.
Is yuh one o’ de America ladies dey done tells
me about?”</p>

<p>“My mother is an American, but my father
is French, so I can speak both French and
English.”</p>

<p>“What part o’ de States is yo’ ma fum?”</p>

<p>“From Virginia.”</p>

<p>Another cheerful laugh greeted this information.
“Ain’t it de troo? now, fum ole Ferginny.
Das jes whar I comes fum. Yo ma is one o’ de
fust famblies, I reckons.”</p>

<p>This was a trifle puzzling to Lucie but she
replied that her mother’s maiden name was
Randolph, which appeared entirely to corroborate
the opinion of the man.</p>

<p>“Mah name Gus Fitchett,” he told Lucie,
“and I comes ovah to fight dem Bushes fo’ dey
git ready to draf me. We gwine bus’ ’em,
too, yuh hyar me. We gwine chase ’em clar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
to Berlin, an’ den kick ’em downhill.” It was
evidently not quite clear in his mind just what
or where Berlin might be, but it was a word to
conjure with, and he wished to impress upon
Lucie his good intentions.</p>

<p>Presently the canteen was reached, Gus was
conducted in and promptly served with a bowl
of soup and a chunk of bread. While he was
eating Lucie whispered her report of him to
Miss Lowndes. “I never saw a black before,”
she said, “but I was curious to see one, and
when he began singing ‘The Old Folks at
Home’ I knew he was not from any other
place than my mother’s country. I can’t
understand half he says, but I think he is very
funny.”</p>

<p>Miss Lowndes laughed. “Bless you, child,
I have been used to that kind of talk all my
life. I wonder what we’d better do with him.
With that wound on his head he shouldn’t be
on the road by himself. I’ll find out where
his regiment is, and Marcus can take him on;
that will be best.” This was done, but it was
not the last of Gus Fitchett, for in a few days
he turned up again at the canteen.</p>

<p>“Well, Gus,” said Miss Lowndes, recognizing
him, “you’re not lost again, are you?”</p>

<p>Gus grinned. “No, miss, I ain’t los’ dis time,
I comes on a purpose. De cunnel, he say I
ain’t fittin’ to be roun’ de mess, an’ he say I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
bettah lay by a few days, gimme leave, he say.
He axes me does I wanter go to a res’ hospital,
I says no, I doesn’t. He axes me whar does I
wanter go, an’ I says ef hit jes de same to him I
comes back whar dey talks lak I kin unnerstan’
’em. He say whar dat. I say whar dat canteen
are an’ dem nice Ferginny ladies, dat
little specially one what got a muvver name o’
Randolph.”</p>

<p>“Well, Gus, we’ll have to fix you up,” said
Miss Lowndes. “You’ll have to have a place to
sleep.”</p>

<p>“I sleeps anywhar, on de flo’, in de barn,
out o’ doors. Don’ mek no decrimination to
me, no, miss, not a bit of decrimination.”</p>

<p>Miss Lowndes bit her lip and told him she
would see that a place was found for him, for
which interest he was grateful accordingly.</p>

<p>“Whar dat young lady live what bring me
here?” he asked after partaking of the coffee
Miss Lowndes offered him.</p>

<p>“Miss Lucie Du Bois? Why do you want
to know?”</p>

<p>“Well, miss, she mighty nice an’ kin’, an’
I thinkin’ maybe I kin do some chores fo’ huh.”</p>

<p>“But you are away on sick leave; you
shouldn’t be doing any work.”</p>

<p>“Doctah he say fo’ me to git outen de trenches
an’ into de open a’r whar de guns isn’t so rambuctious.
He don’t say nothin’ bout me doin’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
little easy chores lak totin’ watah an’ fetchin’ in
de wood.”</p>

<p>“Very well, Gus, if that is the way you feel
about it, Miss Du Bois lives beyond the
church. I will show you. When you leave her
come back here to me and by that time I will
have found a place for you.” She watched him
on his way down the street, then she turned to
Mrs. Graves. “I didn’t believe there was one
of his variety left. He is an old timer. I’ll
venture to say he was brought up by a grandmother
of the good old sort.” In which conjecture
she was perfectly right.</p>

<p>Lucie, working in the garden, was surprised
to hear a soft voice at her side saying: “Miss
Lucie, ain’t dey nothin’ I kin do fo’ yuh?”</p>

<p>Lucie looked up to see the tall form of the
darkey. “Why, Gus,” she exclaimed. “How
is it you are here?”</p>

<p>Gus explained, ending by saying: “’Pears
to me lak it mo’ lak home folks when yo ma
come fum ole Ferginny.”</p>

<p>“Are you homesick, Gus?” Lucie asked
sympathetically.</p>

<p>“Well, Miss Lucie, I mought be ef I was by
mahse’f with dese yer Frenchies, but bein’ as
I’m hyar I ain’t.”</p>

<p>Lucie understood and was touched. His
native state and her mother’s was the same, and
he threw himself upon her tender mercies, so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
she set him to work, knowing he would be
happier so. It was incredible what he accomplished
in his week’s leave. He adopted the
three women as “his fambly” with a niceness of
distinction in his manner toward them which it
would be difficult to analyze. He adored Lucie
as the young lady of the house. He stood ready
to carry out her every wish, and this in spite of
aching head and tired frame, weakened by loss
of blood.</p>

<p>“But there is no fighting yet between the
Americans and the Germans,” Lucie said to him,
“how then do you come to be wounded?”</p>

<p>“Hit happen dishaway,” replied Gus, very
ready to recount the tale; “we alls marchin’
erlong de road. Den erlong come one o’ dese
yer tu’key buzzard Bushes, flyin’, flyin’. ‘Look
out,’ says de captain, an’ we alls jumps, but I
ain’t jump fer enough, an’ I de onliest one git
hit. I thinks ole Gabr’el blow his horn fo’
me sho nuff when de blood come a tricklin’
down mah face, but I reckons I good fer a while
yet. De ole thing bus’ an t’ar up de groun fo’
all de worl lak ole bull. Miss Lucie, whar I
gwine tote dish yer rubbage?”</p>

<p>“Over to the very back of the lot. We are
trying to get the place cleaned up from the front
backward, so as to have it look nice around the
house when my mother gets back.”</p>

<p>“I wishes I had de time to cl’ar hit all up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
spankin’ clean fo’ yuh. I lak git de insides of
de house all cl’ar.”</p>

<p>“You are helping such a lot, Gus. I don’t
know how to thank you.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t yo ma fum ole Ferginny?” was all
the answer Gus vouchsafed.</p>

<p>At the end of his leave he took his departure,
wistfully. He would do his duty, but he preferred
the gentler ways, and would fain have
lingered on, an obedient servant to a considerate
young mistress. Even Paulette, who at first
had regarded him with violent suspicion, came
to see his merits and to appreciate his devotion.
They were to hear of him again.</p>

<p>Under the directions of <i>Les Dames Américaines</i>
the little town began to resume something
of its old look. The good <i>curé</i> helped with
his own hands to patch up the church. More
and more of the residents returned; then one
day there marched in a company of the boys from
overseas. An officer looked for places to billet
them. The factories whose chimneys were gone,
but whose walls stood firm, gave room for a
certain number. One of the better houses was
taken as headquarters. The streets became
full of erect young men who made friends with
the children, hobnobbed with the old men,
did friendly acts for the old women, and generally
made themselves popular. One of the first
to stroll into Miss Lowndes’s little office was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
a young Virginian who appeared more than
usually eager to ask questions. He wore the
stripes of a lieutenant.</p>

<p>“I am quartered here,” he began. “I wonder
if you can tell me anything of the people who are
living here and of those who did live here before
the town was evacuated.”</p>

<p>“I think perhaps I can tell you something,”
replied Miss Lowndes, smiling up into the frank
blue eyes. “Was it some particular family you
wanted to inquire about?”</p>

<p>“Well, yes—” he began, but was interrupted
by the arrival of his captain who had a dozen
things to ask about. Taking the first opportunity
to say he would come in again, the young
man saluted, and strode off down the street.
Midway to the church he came face to face with
a slender, brown-eyed girl behind whom trotted
a small dog who once in a while favored one of
his hind legs. “By Jove, that girl’s face looks
familiar,” said the man aloud. “I know I have
seen her before, but where?”</p>

<p>Lucie looked up and smiled. It might not be
the thing to do, but he was an American and she
felt kindly toward every one of them.</p>

<p>The smile was encouragement enough for the
young man to take off his cap and say: “I
beg your pardon, but haven’t we met before?”
Then he gave an impatient gesture. “Bother,”
he exclaimed, “of course she doesn’t speak<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
English. Pardon, mademoiselle, <i>mais-mais</i>.”
He paused helplessly.</p>

<p>Lucie smiled again. “Pardon me, monsieur,
but I do speak English.”</p>

<p>“Good! I was sure we must have met, but
I cannot remember where.”</p>

<p>“Nor I, monsieur.” She studied his face
carefully, “and yet, and yet I seem to have
seen you.”</p>

<p>“My name is Philip Randolph, from Virginia.”</p>

<p>“And I am Lucie Du Bois, a native of this
place.”</p>

<p>“Not Lucie Du Bois, the daughter of Louise
and Marcel Du Bois?”</p>

<p>“Those are the names of my parents.”</p>

<p>“Lucie, little Lucie! My blessed child, I
am your uncle Phil!” And without further
ceremony he put his arms around her and hugged
her tight up to him, to the horror and dismay
of an old woman nearing the church.</p>

<p>Blushing and laughing Lucie disengaged herself.
“I am so glad, so very glad to see you,”
she murmured.</p>

<p>“Let’s go somewhere and talk,” suggested
Philip. “I haven’t heard a word from my sister
since the first year of the war. We knew this
town was occupied by the Germans for a time,
that your father was at the front, but what had
become of you all there seemed to be no way to
find out.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>“There is much to tell,” replied Lucie, a look
of sadness passing over her face. “Our home
was nearly destroyed, but we are living in a part
of it, at least—But here is Paulette. Perhaps
you know who Paulette is.”</p>

<p>Paulette with an expression of outraged
dignity approached. That Lucie should so far
forget herself as to permit an ardent embrace
in the eyes of the public, and, so far as she could
see, from a perfectly unknown young man, was
scandalous. The child must have gone mad.</p>

<p>Lucie, however, seemed not in the least
ashamed. She ran to meet Paulette, seized her
by the hands and urged her forward. “Such a
surprise, Paulette,” she cried. “Who do you
think this is?”</p>

<p>Paulette regarded the young man who stood
smiling down at her. She shook her head uncompromisingly.
“I have never seen monsieur
before.”</p>

<p>“Of course you haven’t, but I have, although
I don’t remember it, for I was only three years
old when mama took me to see her people. This
is my Uncle Philip, my very own uncle.”</p>

<p>“Monsieur!” Paulette clasped her hands
rapturously. “I ask ten thousand pardons.”</p>

<p>“I am taking him home, Paulette, where we
can talk. You will find us there when you come
back.”</p>

<p>“I was only a little kid about twelve years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
old, but I remember what a darling child you
were,” said Philip, as they continued their
way.</p>

<p>“It is a long time, nearly fifteen years ago,
and I am no more a child,” returned Lucie
soberly.</p>

<p>“You have had hard times, then?”</p>

<p>“I will tell you.”</p>

<p>She took him to the pathetically poor little
home and there she told him all. More than
once during the recital he sprang from the
broken step upon which they were sitting and
paced the walk, biting his lip and muttering
under his breath. At the close of her story he
broke forth into rapid speech. “My sister!
My sister! We must find her. If only I may
be spared to look for her, to bring her back. I
must try to get in touch with your father. You
know where he is?”</p>

<p>Lucie gave him the address, which he carefully
wrote down in his notebook.</p>

<p>“What a duffer to think I should find you all
in some safe place. If I had only known. If I
had only come sooner.”</p>

<p>“What could you have done, my uncle?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, but I could have tried.”</p>

<p>“We have all tried, my father, our friends,
our relatives. The German line is like a sealed
wall, one cannot tell what goes on behind it,
but we hope, always we hope. Others have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
come back and so will she. Now that you have
come the war will soon be over.”</p>

<p>“Pray God it will. Couldn’t you find a
better place than this to live in, Lucie? There
are many quite good houses at the other end of
the town.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but they are not ours; this is home.”</p>

<p>“You poor, dear, loyal little thing. I know
that is the way all the French feel; a foot of
earth that is their very own is worth more than
another’s acres. Well, we shall have to see
about getting a roof on your house, and some
windows and doors set in. Has your father
seen it?”</p>

<p>“No, we do not wish that he see it till we have
it better.”</p>

<p>He smiled at her phrasing. “Well, I must
be going. Time’s up. I shall try to see you
every day. I don’t know how long we shall be
here, not very long, I fancy. By the way, who
is that peach of a girl at the canteen?”</p>

<p>“You mean Miss Lowndes? She is my very
dear friend.”</p>

<p>“You show good taste. She is a perfect
pippin.” And Philip walked off, leaving his
little niece looking admiringly after him.</p>

<p>He made a second call upon Miss Lowndes
the next morning. “I am Lieutenant Randolph,”
he announced himself, “Lucie Du Bois’s
uncle. She tells me you are a friend of hers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
and I am wondering what we can do to better
things for her. She shouldn’t be living in that
little hovel all mixed up with the others. They
may be used to it, but she isn’t.”</p>

<p>“She prefers it, you see. It has been her
one desire to get back here to her old home,
no matter in what condition it might be.”</p>

<p>“I understand that, and of course in mild
weather it isn’t so hard, but in bad weather it
must be awful. I have been trying to get in
touch with my brother-in-law, Lucie’s father, but
so far have not been able to do so.”</p>

<p>Miss Lowndes was silent for a moment, during
which time she made repeated jabs with the
point of her pencil into the pad before her.
“Then you do not know,” she said presently,
“that Lucie’s father has been taken prisoner.”</p>

<p>Philip made a muttered exclamation. “When
did you hear?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Only to-day. I have not told Lucie, for
I think it is enough for her to be concerned
about her mother. Oh, do please hurry up and
end this war.”</p>

<p>Philip smiled. “I think you may count on
us to do our little best.”</p>

<p>“I am sure of that. You don’t know what
faith we all are putting in you.”</p>

<p>“That’s what helps, too. But about Lucie.
Isn’t there some way to get one of those little
readymade houses?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>“We do get them, yes.”</p>

<p>“They are at least better than what she is
living in, and could be used for some one else if
the old house is ever rebuilt. It could be set
up there alongside the shed, couldn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Surely.”</p>

<p>“Is it a feasible plan?”</p>

<p>“It looks so to me. I will inquire into it.”</p>

<p>“Thanks.” He held out his hand. “We
may not be quartered here very long. Miss
Lowndes. I may never return; that’s part of
the game, you know, but before I leave I
should like to feel satisfied that our little Lucie
is housed better than a goat or a rabbit.”</p>

<p>“All right,” returned Miss Lowndes smiling,
“we will do our best, I promise you. It is
quite within our rights, of course.”</p>

<p>“If it is a question of funds,” Philip
began.</p>

<p>“Of course that is a consideration. We have
none to spare, of course.”</p>

<p>“So I surmised. I’ll foot the bill if you will
put the thing over. Is it a go?”</p>

<p>“So far as I am concerned it certainly is.
Come in to-morrow morning and I shall be able
to tell you more about it, and I think we’d better
not say anything to Lucie about her father until
she asks questions.”</p>

<p>“I agree with you. I’ll come in to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Miss Lowndes watched him striding down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
the street, an erect soldierly fellow. “What a
nice man he is! what an awfully nice man,”
she said half aloud. “I hope he will be billeted
here for a long time, for Lucie’s sake,” she added,
though back of that wish was one for herself.</p>

<p>She saw him the next morning and the next
and the next. In fact there was not a day
during his stay that the two did not meet, if
only for a moment.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br>

<small>JOY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THROUGH the combined efforts of Miss
Lowndes, Philip Randolph and some others,
the little house of four rooms was set up near the
shed, the latter serving as a place in which to
house the fowls, the rabbits and a goat which was
the pride of Paulette’s heart. Of course all this
was not accomplished at once, but her uncle had
the satisfaction of seeing Lucie installed in her
new home before he left the town. She parted
from him with sorrow. He was something her
very own, her mother’s brother, and the tie of
blood was strong. She had learned, before this,
of her father’s capture in a night raid when
he had sacrificed himself to save his men. Jean
brought them an account of it, and the honest
fellow wept as he told of it. His “capitaine”
was beloved above all men.</p>

<p>In August the French retook ground at Verdun
which they had lost the year before. In October
they won more ground north of the Aisne. In
November came the first encounter between the
Americans and the enemy. The latter part of
the same month began the battle of Cambrai,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
when the big crawling tanks did their good work
and the British won successes. And so the
year went out with victory still hanging in the
balance.</p>

<p>In all these months Lucie had seen nothing of
Victor. She heard from <i>Coin-du-Pres</i> that
Annette had returned, and the first of the year
brought the wonderful news that there was a
baby Gaspard. The little mother could speak
of nothing else in her letters, and it was evident
that the whole household was given over to
adoring this new member of it.</p>

<p>The winter went quietly enough. There was
much work in the canteen. In answer to hurry
calls Lucie, Paulette and Odette would drop
everything at home, in order to lend a hand in
ladling soup and pouring coffee, returning home
late at night, quite exhausted but with a warm
glow of satisfaction at having been doing a
service to France.</p>

<p>Then in March came the great drive. Nearer
and nearer advanced the Germans. At one time
it seemed as if they must sweep everything before
them. The sound of threatening guns grew
more and more menacing. The fires of burning
villages lighted up the horizon. Lucie and
Odette clung together wishing that they had
never left <i>Coin-du-Pres</i>. Paulette with an expression
of savage fury muttered as she went
about her work. Then one morning came a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
messenger from Miss Lowndes. “We are preparing
to evacuate the town. Be ready when
you are called upon to leave.”</p>

<p>“Again? Not again?” cried Lucie aghast.</p>

<p>“That’s what it looks like,” said Marcus, the
driver of the canteen motor car. “Fritzie is
getting back at us. We’ve got to be ready.”</p>

<p>“How soon shall we have to go?”</p>

<p>“Can’t tell. I’ll let you know in time. All
you’ve got to do is to be ready.”</p>

<p>He went off to continue his work of warning.
Some of the people at once began to depart,
refugees again; others sought safety in cellars,
dreading a nearer roar of guns and the whistle
of shells. Twenty-four hours of dread. No one
slept that night. Who knew when a shell might
come crashing down upon the town? Big
Bertha was doing deadly work in Paris, what
might not one expect here?</p>

<p>Then came the morning when out of their
houses and cellars flocked the people. A shout
went up. The three in the little new house ran
to the gate. A boy was running up the street
waving his arms and crying: “They’re driven
back! They’re driven back! <i>Vive la France!</i>”</p>

<p>“We’re safe! We’re safe!” cried Lucie.</p>

<p>“For the moment,” returned Paulette. “I
for one do not unpack.”</p>

<p>But though, as time went on, there was a
swaying back and forth of the line, no farther<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
in that direction did the foe advance. Not a
shot fell in the town, and, beyond, the country
was peaceful and smiling.</p>

<p>For days those in the little town waited
tremblingly the German advance. Must they
be driven out a second time? It seemed almost
as if it must be so for many towns and villages
which had been reëstablished were now being
evacuated and the dwellers therein taken farther
back to safety, with all their supplies and even
their livestock, much of this the excellent work
of the American Committee for Devastated
France. As time went on and danger threatened
more and more, it almost seemed that the big
guns would be directed the next moment upon
the town, and that the bombs would finish
the work of destruction begun four years before.
But beyond a certain point the enemy did not
penetrate. The fields were unscathed, the buildings
unscarred. The great Juggernaut of war
had not crushed them.</p>

<p>There was much hard fighting, so many lives
lost that Lucie at last came to be thankful that her
father was out of it, even though his might not
be an enviable position. At least she might hope
that he would survive and that she could see him
again. That veil of silence still covered her
mother, while the Allies were continuing their
triumphant advance, and town after town was
liberated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>Then one day the veil was lifted. It was in
October. Lucie, with her pigeons flocking around
her, heard a sudden call from Odette. “Come,
come quickly, there are persons coming up the
street and I think they are looking for this
house.”</p>

<p>Lucie went to the gate to see two men and a
woman approaching. One was a soldier with an
empty sleeve and wearing the French uniform.
A second soldier was plainly an American, and
as he came nearer Lucie distinguished her uncle
Philip. The woman she did not recognize at the
first instant, but presently with a wild cry of
joy the girl darted out the gate to throw herself,
sobbing hysterically, into the arms of her very
own mother.</p>

<p>“Oh, mother, mother,” she murmured, clinging
to her as if she could never let her go, “I knew
you would come. I knew it. I never gave up
hope, in all these years I never did. Let me look
at you, my own mother, to be very sure.”</p>

<p>She looked very worn and much, very much,
older, this dear mother, but the general appearance
was the same. The two stood gazing at
each other, lost to all else. Madame Du Bois’s
abundant hair had grown thinner and showed
streaks of gray. She was very thin, and the
happy, buoyant expression she had always worn
had given place to an expression of patient
sadness. “You have changed, my little Lucie,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
she said. “My little girl is gone and here is
one almost a young lady in her place.”</p>

<p>“No, no, <i>maman</i>, I am still your little girl.
I may have grown but my heart is still as you
left it.” They clung and kissed again as if this
were the sum of all desire.</p>

<p>After a while the young Frenchman spoke up.
“Have you yet no word of greeting for an old
friend, Lucie?” he asked.</p>

<p>She disengaged herself from her mother’s
embrace to turn to him. “Victor!” she exclaimed,
and held out both her hands. “This
is wonderful, wonderful beyond words! And
my uncle too. It is like a miracle, a vision,
that you all three should appear at the same
moment.”</p>

<p>Here Paulette came running out, gesticulating,
crying, uttering disconnected words. “Madame,
it is my dear madame! It is not then a shadow
that I see, a spirit. Madame, if I but may
embrace you, this Paulette who has never ceased
to mourn for you.”</p>

<p>“My good Paulette, dear Paulette, that I
should find you here so faithfully guarding my
Lucie,” returned Madame Du Bois, kissing the
good woman on each cheek. “I have heard, oh,
yes, they have told me of your faithfulness, your
care of my little child, for which I can never
thank you enough.”</p>

<p>“And Odette, you must know her,” declared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
Lucie. “Oh, there is so much to tell. It will
take years, years, to say it all.”</p>

<p>Odette, who had been keeping in the background,
was brought forward, then Madame Du
Bois caught sight of Pom Pom who was sniffing
around trying to make up his mind if he should
dash out the gate and bark or keep a respectful
distance. “Pom Pom, you still have Pom Pom,”
exclaimed Madame Du Bois.</p>

<p>At this instant Victor whistled, and unheeding
gates and bars Pom Pom made a frantic effort,
leaped over the gate and flew to his master,
fawning at his feet and whimpering with joy.
“He at least is glad to see me,” said Victor.</p>

<p>“Oh, but Victor,” Lucie turned to him, “I am
glad to see you, and I am so grieved to see that
you have been wounded. Tell me when and
how.”</p>

<p>“That will keep,” returned he. “All I want
is the assurance that you are glad to see me,
even though I am not all here.”</p>

<p>They all went in to learn of the many, many
things which had befallen each one since their
parting.</p>

<p>“And where have you been, darling mother,
all this time?” was Lucie’s first question.</p>

<p>“In a town which was held by the Germans
till very recently. I was caught there on my
way from home, and there I have been ever
since.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>“Were you badly treated?”</p>

<p>“Sometimes better, sometimes worse; it depended
on who was in command. I was obliged
to work, at times, beyond my strength. I was
fortunate not to be deported, as so many others
were, but I think my claims to being American
born spared me that.”</p>

<p>“Good!” exclaimed her brother.</p>

<p>“I sent you a message,” Madame Du Bois
went on, “but I never knew whether it reached
you. An old man in the town determined to
try to escape. I knew of his intention, and sent
the message which I knew would not incriminate
him in any way if he were captured.”</p>

<p>“It did reach us,” Lucie told her, “and has
been the one gleam of comfort that my father
and I have had. You know, perhaps, mamma,
about my father, and that dear grandfather has
left us.”</p>

<p>“I have heard. Victor has told me some
things, many things indeed, and Philip has told
me others.” She sighed.</p>

<p>“Cheer up, Louise,” said her brother. “We’re
driving those Boches clear out of sight, and before
you know it there won’t be a spiked helmet
this side the Rhine. We’re driving them fast.”</p>

<p>“Dear Philip,” said Madame Du Bois, looking
at him affectionately. “I can’t believe that
my baby brother has grown into this big, six-foot
soldier. We must talk of things at home, for you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
know we have hardly touched upon that subject
yet.”</p>

<p>“Why, when did you meet him?” inquired
Lucie.</p>

<p>“Just before we started to come here from the
canteen.”</p>

<p>“But this is even more strange. How was it?”</p>

<p>“Let Monsieur Victor tell you,” spoke up
Philip, “while I talk to sister. I haven’t much
time to spare this trip.”</p>

<p>Lucie turned to Victor. “Tell me,” she
said.</p>

<p>“I met madame, your mother, in a town back
there,” Victor commenced to say.</p>

<p>“But you were not fighting, of course. You
were not with your company.”</p>

<p>“No, I had been in a hospital for this,” he
touched his empty sleeve, “and was discharged,
but I could not stay away, and when I learned
that the towns were being evacuated, and that
those who had been under German control were
being liberated, I asked the boys to do something
I could not do, so they did this and when your
mother came through the place where I was I
joined her and we came on together. I wanted
to come, you know, to see—Pom Pom.”</p>

<p>“Look here,” Philip broke in, “it doesn’t seem
to me that he’s telling that right. There’s too
little of it. I can’t understand it all, you know,
but I can make out quite a lot. Better let me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
tell it. The boy was just out of the hospital.
He was to go home. Does he go? Not a bit of
it. He works it so he gets permission to help
at one of the Red Cross stations. He told them
that he wished above all things to discover the
whereabouts of one Madame Louise Du Bois.
She was supposed to be interned in one of the
towns held by the Germans, unless she had been
deported to Germany. He talked so persistently
and interested so many persons that the word was
passed along and your precious mother was
finally located and sent on to this Red Cross
station where Mons. Victor Guerin met her and
escorted her to her own home.”</p>

<p>“What is this he says?” asked Victor, hearing
his name.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said Lucie. “It is nothing
to your discredit, Victor. In fact I find you a
hero, you dear, good Victor, for you discovered
my mother.”</p>

<p>“I did nothing at all. I simply made inquiries
and asked others to do the same.”</p>

<p>“But it was through you that she was able to
come home. You found her.”</p>

<p>“I did not find her. They of the <i>Croix Rouge</i>
did that and sent us here. At the canteen in
this town we find your uncle.”</p>

<p>“Aha!” exclaimed Lucie. “And how long,
my sly uncle, had you been there?”</p>

<p>Philip colored up and laughed a trifle confusedly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
“Really it was only a few minutes.
I was coming here right away. As I was saying,
Louise, mother would not say a word to discourage
my coming.”</p>

<p>Lucie gently touched Victor’s empty sleeve.
“It is very sad,” she said softly. “I wish I
could tell you how I feel for you.”</p>

<p>“It is not so bad,” returned Victor cheerfully,
though his eyes had a pathetic expression. “I
have had the supreme joy of doing this much for
France! I have given what I could of myself
and have come out better than many of my
comrades who have lost their sight or who
must be entirely helpless the rest of their lives.
I shall do very well, for it is my left arm,
and I can have a most ingeniously contrived
substitute.”</p>

<p>“I suppose he has told you of his <i>Croix de
Guerre</i>.” Philip spoke again.</p>

<p>“You have the cross, Victor. Then you are a
hero,” Lucie said.</p>

<p>“I deserved it no more than many another
who did not receive it, yet I was very proud when
they gave it to me at the hospital.”</p>

<p>“So am I proud, and so will your grandmother
be. I suppose you will soon be going to <i>Coin-du-Pres</i>.”</p>

<p>“Yes, although just now it is rather a <i>triste</i>
place. I think they would rather I did not
come at once.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>“But why <i>triste</i> at this special time?”</p>

<p>“You have heard that my cousin Gaspard is
no more? that he was killed on the Italian
front?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, Victor, I had not heard. Poor little
Annette a widow! How very sad. What a
blessed thing that she has her baby.”</p>

<p>“That is the great comfort.”</p>

<p>“And shall you go back to take Gaspard’s
place?”</p>

<p>“I do not think so. I shall go for a time, of
course. The little son is the heir, you realize
that.”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course. Then what are your plans?”</p>

<p>“I have none as yet. I can have none.” He
spoke quite mournfully, dejectedly, and Lucie
felt a great wave of compassion sweep over her.
Victor, always so joyous and gay, to be like this,
like one who had looked into the very depths
of misery and horror and who had not crept back
yet to a place where he could behold brighter
visions!</p>

<p>He went away with her uncle soon after, promising
to return in the morning. She watched
the pair going off down the street, one in horizon
blue, the other in khaki, then she returned to her
mother and the two talked till the October
twilight deepened to dark.</p>

<p>Lucie wondered why, now that the sum of her
greatest wish was granted, she did not feel more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
tranquil as she lay that night with wide-open
eyes fixed upon a bright star which sent its beams
through her little window. She concluded that
it was because of her father and Annette, though
she had been thinking less of them than of Victor
and of <i>Coin-du-Pres</i>. Why should it not be a
good thing for Victor to marry Annette, not yet
of course, but after a while? She considered
this possibility for a little time, but somehow did
not care to continue the subject. Then she
decided that a better plan would be to have her
Uncle Philip marry Annette. It would keep him
in France, and give Annette a near relationship.
But suddenly she remembered her uncle’s look of
confusion when she rallied him upon his tarrying
at the canteen, and she came to the conclusion
that this pretty plan was not to be depended
upon. Was he spending the evening with Miss
Lowndes, and where was Victor? She had not
had any curiosity about this matter before now,
but she at once began to wonder why Victor had
not returned to spend the evening with his old
friends. What was he doing? There were other
girls in the town whom he had met in days gone
by. Perhaps he was renewing old acquaintances.
Victor—her mother—her father—Victor. It
was the thought of Victor, after all, which found
her dropping off at last to sleep.</p>

<p>She awoke in the morning with a new and
delightful sense of something unusually pleasant.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
Her mother! She sat up in bed and looked
across to the other side of the room where, upon
a cot, her mother was sleeping peacefully. For
some moments Lucie sat gazing at her, a flood
tide of joy surging through her. It was no
dream. She had believed. Odette had believed
that this day would come and their faith was
justified.</p>

<p>Presently her mother opened her eyes and
smiled. Lucie sprang out of bed and went over
to cuddle down in her embrace. To be sure the
cot was narrow but neither minded that.</p>

<p>“We shall scarcely have room enough in this
little house when papa comes,” said Lucie. “To
be sure this is much better than the shed where
we lived at first.”</p>

<p>“You are very confident that your father will
come, dear child.”</p>

<p>“Of course, just as I was confident that you
would come, and here you are. It was Uncle
Philip, you know, who was instrumental in getting
us this.”</p>

<p>“Dear Phil; he always was the most generous
boy.”</p>

<p>“Weren’t you surprised to see him?”</p>

<p>“Surprised and overjoyed.”</p>

<p>“How did you happen to recognize him?
You hadn’t seen him since he was a little
boy.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t recognize him at first. Victor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>
thought it would be well to stop at the canteen
to inquire if you were still here. Philip was
there talking to the young lady,—Miss Lowndes
is her name?”</p>

<p>“Of course he would be,” Lucie interpolated
the remark. “He talks a great deal to Miss
Lowndes, I notice.”</p>

<p>“Does he? Well, he might spend his time in a
worse way. At all events when Victor made his
inquiries Philip turned around and looked very
sharply at me. Then he came rushing over.
‘Louise, Louise,’ he cried, ‘is it really my sister
Louise?’ I am sure I don’t know how he could
tell, changed as I must be, but he did, so we
hugged and kissed and cried, all of us. Miss
Lowndes included, and then we came on.”</p>

<p>“How did you get to S——?”</p>

<p>“We came in a motor car belonging to the Red
Cross.”</p>

<p>“The next joy will be the arrival of papa;
then we shall all be at home together, all but
dear grandfather. You learned about him and
about poor little Annette, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“I heard. It is very sad about Annette; she
is so very young.”</p>

<p>“But I didn’t tell you about Mousse. He was
prowling last night so you didn’t see him, but he
has come back. Wasn’t it remarkable that he
should have stayed all that time in the town?
That first night, oh, mamma. I felt as if I should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
die. It was all so desolate, so forlorn. I found
a piece of the blue dress you used to wear; it was
down among the débris. It was only a bit of
rag, and had been rained upon and shined upon
till it was faded and queer, but it seemed like a
part of you, and it almost broke my heart.
Mother, mother, is it really you? Do you mind
if I pinch you to see if you are flesh and blood?”</p>

<p>Her mother hugged her so closely as to prove
herself no dream, whispering fond words all the
while.</p>

<p>“And there is Pom Pom,” Lucie went on after
a while. “I have a great deal to tell you about
him. Oh, dear, I have just thought, I suppose I
shall have to give him back to Victor.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think Victor deserves that you
should?”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, yes. Mamma, if I begin to tell
you everything about Victor, all the wonderful
things he has done and what a wonderful friend
he has been, we shall never get up for it will take
till to-morrow morning. We shall have to select
one subject each day. One day it will have to be
Victor, another Pom Pom, another Paulette,
another Odette, another <i>Coin-du-Pres</i> and Annette,
and so on. I’m up!”</p>

<p>She sprang out of bed but continued to chatter
away while she was dressing, then she ran down
to see if the hens had laid any fresh eggs for her
mother’s breakfast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>But it was not her father who next appeared on
the scene; it was Jean. Though before this
great things had taken place. The Allied
armies’ victorious advance had brought them to
the borders of peace, though it was not yet, and
every one was excitedly expectant. October gave
place to November, then, in a few days came the
news of Austria’s desire to discuss an armistice.
The end was near.</p>

<p>It was not long after this that Jean came.
Lucie heard him talking to his mother in the
garden, one morning very early. They were
standing near the spot where the valuables were
buried on that day of their flight. Paulette had
cleared away the pile of dead branches. Lucie
watched Jean strike his spade into the damp
earth, and dig on steadily till he had come to one
of the boxes. Lucie could stand it no longer,
but slipped into her dress, threw something warm
over her and ran down to view the unearthing.
She called to Odette on the way and the two
came out together.</p>

<p>The boxes were intact. Jean carried them
into the house and opened them. Everything
was there, although the papers were moldy and
the silver tarnished. While Paulette was fussing
over the boxes Odette went out to feed the
chickens. Jean followed, saying he would fill
up the hole made by the boxes.</p>

<p>A little while later Lucie looked out. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
spade was still sticking up in the earth as Jean
had left it. “I wonder what Jean is doing,”
remarked Lucie.</p>

<p>Paulette chuckled. “He is occupying himself
very agreeably, I fancy.”</p>

<p>Presently Odette came back, her big eyes soft
with emotion. She went quickly to Paulette
and held out her hands appealingly.</p>

<p>“I know all about it, little daughter,” said
Paulette, kissing her on each cheek, “and it is as
I wish. <i>Le bon Dieu</i> has answered my prayer.”</p>

<p>Odette looked shyly down at a ring on her
hand. It was made of steel and set with a bit
of blue glass. She held it out for Lucie to see.
“Jean made it for me from a piece of a Boche’s
helmet and the blue is from the cathedral at
Rheims.” She softly kissed the ring, at the
same time looking at Lucie to see if she understood.</p>

<p>Lucie turned to Paulette who stood smiling
exultantly. “They are fianced,” she said, “and
now I shall again have a daughter.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX<br>

<small>THE END IS PEACE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE towers of the little church were gone,
the bells, carried off by the Germans, could
give forth no joyous peal, but there came a
day when the small town joined the rest of the
world in celebrating the news of the armistice.
“Make a joyful noise, all ye lands,” quoted the
old <i>curé</i> as he stood on the steps of the church
and smiled indulgently upon the boys who were
raising a tremendous din with any kind of thing
that would furnish a noise. An old bugle, a
sheet of tin and a hammer, cow bells and sheep
bells, were in great requisition. There was a
descent upon the kitchens, every boy carrying
off whatsoever he could lay his hands upon, from
a tin plate to a copper cauldron, and he did it
unreproved. People stood in little knots talking
excitedly, weeping, shouting, singing. Anything
resembling a tricolor was waved, was
hung from windows, was carried in parade upon
the end of a stick. The last gun was fired at
eleven <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> At that hour from the church
steps the old <i>curé</i> raised his hands in benediction
before he began mass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>Lucie and Odette joined the marching throng
to swell the volume of song when the strains of
the Marseillaise arose above the din. An old
man with an ancient cornet played the air, the
boys beat wildly upon their improvised drums.
Men, women and children joined in.</p>

<p>Presently at the end of the procession appeared
a grinning black face. A negro soldier
with a small American flag stuck in his hat,
deftly rattled a set of bones and lent his voice
to the singing with a fervor unmistakable even
if his rendering of the words was peculiar:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“O, sarm city on,</div>
<div class="verse">Form a batty one,”</div>
</div></div>

<p>sang Gus Fitchett, then suddenly to the intense
delight of the boys he broke into a series of
pigeon wings, double shuffles, and cake walks,
keeping time with his clattering bones. In a
moment there was an end of the singing and
Gus was the center of a group which cheered,
applauded, urged him on till he stopped exhausted
to wipe his perspiring face.</p>

<p>All at once he stiffened up rigidly and stood
at attention as an American officer came up,
whom he saluted. Philip Randolph, trying to
repress a smile said authoritatively: “You
black rascal, what are you up to?”</p>

<p>Gus gave a series of salutes. “Jes’ celebratin’,
suh. Wah obah, suh.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>“You’ll be over, over in the guard house if
you don’t look out,” said Philip. “Hallo,
Lucie, are you in this, too?”</p>

<p>“Of course. Please don’t scold Gus; he is
such a dear.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you know him, do you?”</p>

<p>“Indeed I do. He’ll fall at your feet if I
tell him you’re my uncle from Virginia. Wasn’t
his dancing wonderful?”</p>

<p>“Pretty good. I used to perform that way
myself when I was a boy, but I never was quite
as limber as that. To tell you the truth I
haven’t had such a reminder of home since I
left. It’s lucky I know his kind or he’d be reported.
What about this—Gus is his name?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I suppose he is on leave.
He heads straight for this place the minute he
gets a furlough, and all because I was good to
him that first day when he came in with a
broken head. The war is over, really?”</p>

<p>“Practically, though, confound it, my regiment
wasn’t in the front line when they sent
over the last shot. I’m here instead of there.”</p>

<p>“On leave?”</p>

<p>“On my way from Paris, official business.”</p>

<p>“But you will be coming back this way again
soon?”</p>

<p>“I hope so.”</p>

<p>“And when do you return home?”</p>

<p>“That’s something no fellow can find out.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>
I may hang around for months, may go any
time. I must run in for a brief moment to see
your mother and then I’m off.”</p>

<p>After his one day of proud celebration when he
enjoyed to the fullest his position as central
attraction, Gus Fitchett faded out of sight, and
was seen no more in those parts, though one
day, weeks later, came a postcard from Boulogne,
a gay and giddy Christmas card bearing in
crooked and weird handwriting Lucie’s name.
“Mery Crismuss and good-by Mis Lucy. I
salin fo home,” it read.</p>

<p>Meanwhile those who lived at S—— watched
and waited for news of returning prisoners. By
the end of November a million and a half had
been released and were finding their way back to
France. It was not to be supposed that the
friends of Captain Du Bois would overlook him,
or that they would fail to see, providing he
were still alive, that he reached home safely.
The Y.M.C.A., the Salvation Army, the Knights
of Columbus, helped the army in their task of
feeding and directing these returned prisoners.
Many of them were in a pitiable condition;
others were not in so bad a state as it was feared
they would be. All were underfed, many were
ill.</p>

<p>It was just before Christmas. The little
house of the Du Bois’s was warm and snug,
cold though it was outside. Madame Du Bois<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>
and Lucie occupied one of the upstairs rooms;
Paulette and Odette the other. The fowls, the
rabbits, the goat were safely and comfortably
housed in the shed. From the kitchen issued
savory odors. Mousse, in his usual Sybaritic
way, sought out the warmest spot near the stove
there. In the next room Madame Du Bois was
sewing. She had regained some of her charming
air of distinction. Her soft hair, though showing
streaks of gray, was shining and prettily
arranged. Her dress, simple enough, sat well
upon her graceful figure. Lucie, too, since her
mother’s return had more the appearance of one
delicately bred. Pom Pom was curled up at her
feet. There was silver on the table and a bit
of green in a tall vase gave an attempt at
Christmas decoration. The room held a few
chairs, a table, a set of shelves, a divan cot
covered with a homespun quilt, found back in
the country where Miss Lowndes had taken
Madame Du Bois and Lucie one day on a
foraging expedition. On the same day they
had been able to get some crude mats for the
floor, which added to the room’s look of comfort.</p>

<p>“Mamma,” said Lucie, suddenly raising her
head, “do you know that Jean and Odette have
decided to be married at Easter. Paulette has
said so and that settles it. She made up her
mind long ago that those two should marry,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>
and had Jean all in a state of mind to agree,
though I must say that it wasn’t hard to persuade
him, for he loves Odette and she loves him,
which is very fortunate. Mamma, is that the
way you are going to do?”</p>

<p>“What way, dear daughter?”</p>

<p>“Pick out some one and say to me: here’s
your husband.”</p>

<p>Madame Du Bois smiled. “Isn’t it rather
early to begin to worry about that?”</p>

<p>“Why, I don’t know. Look at Annette,
engaged, married, widowed by the time she was
nineteen. Of course, dearest mother, I love
you too much to marry any one against your
wishes, but I do want to choose my own husband
just as you did.”</p>

<p>“Have you any one in mind?” Madame Du
Bois was still smiling.</p>

<p>“I haven’t quite decided, though I think
perhaps I shall marry an American, they are so
nice and polite and kind. I love to see the way
they make friends with the children. The only
trouble is that he would want to take me home
to his own country. Some of those who come
to the canteen are very good looking. Uncle
Phil has promised to bring some of those he
knows over here to see us, though he hasn’t
done it yet. I think maybe he wants to keep
them from seeing Miss Lowndes. Don’t you
think he likes Miss Lowndes very much?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>“Very much, and she is a lovely girl. Well,
dear daughter, so long as you are still casting
about in your mind for a proper person to fall
in love with I do not think we may have any
uneasiness about the state of your heart.”</p>

<p>“Of course I have an ideal,” Lucie continued
the subject. “Sometimes I am very certain
he is an American; again I tell myself I could
only marry a Frenchman, a soldier of France,
of course. I do so adore my France, and I
might not like the United States. It is very
hard to decide,” she sighed.</p>

<p>After a silence she spoke again. “Annette
was not really in love with Gaspard, though she
loved him very much after they were married.
I’d love to see her and the baby.”</p>

<p>“Now that the war is over you may have
the chance of going again to <i>Coin-du-Pres</i>. I
should like to go there myself to thank them in
person for their goodness to you, and to see our
good neighbors again. I suppose for the present
Victor will stay there, and in course of time he
may marry Annette. It would be an excellent
arrangement.”</p>

<p>“Oh, mamma, do you think so?”</p>

<p>“Certainly; an admirable arrangement.”</p>

<p>“They are cousins.”</p>

<p>“Not very nearly related, not too near.”</p>

<p>Lucie dropped the work she was engaged upon
and sat for a long time gazing into the fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>Her meditations were broken in upon by the
sound of voices outside. She sprang to her
feet. “Mother,” she breathed, “if it should be!”</p>

<p>Madame Du Bois arose and stood shaking
nervously. “I am still easily unstrung,” she
murmured weakly. “Go and see who it is,
Lucie.”</p>

<p>Pom Pom pricked up his ears and growled,
then whined to be let out. Lucie went to the
door. Two men stood there; one was Jean,
easily enough recognized, the second she could
not at once identify. But presently she gave
a wild cry. “It is! It is! Mother, come
quickly; it is papa!”</p>

<p>And so it was, very thin and haggard, rather
weakly trembling, but unharmed. For a while
there were more tears than smiles, but they were
tears of joy.</p>

<p>Upon the scarred and tortured land descended
the spirit of Christmas. In spite of countless
crosses, stretching mile after mile across the country,
in spite of deserted firesides, of blackened
ruins, of sickening memories and mourning hearts,
there was peace. The children of France gave
reverent thanks and rejoiced that their beloved
land, torn, despoiled, devastated though it was,
still remained their own land.</p>

<p>“In her children lie her hopes,” said the old
<i>curé</i>, stopping to speak to Captain Du Bois.
“The flower of our country has been cut down,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>
but the roots are there and from them will
spring up a new race of men. There is much
to do, my dear Marcel, but it will be accomplished
in time. It may be years before we
see the land restored; it may not be in my day,
but in yours. Oh, yes, I have faith to believe
it will not be many years before France will be
as radiantly lovely as ever. We have suffered,
but we do not despair, and we shall learn how
blessed is work. You build up your chimneys
again. Marcel?” He looked toward the factories.</p>

<p>“I hope to,” replied Captain Du Bois. “It
must be a question of time, of course. I am
not so hale as I was, and wish I might unite my
experience to the enthusiasm of a younger man.”</p>

<p>The <i>curé</i> nodded. “That may work out.
One cannot tell. The ways of Heaven are manifold.
The hour and the man frequently arrive
together. It will be a happy day for me when I
see our town restored to some of its former usefulness
and beauty. It will come, Marcel;
it will come. Much has been taken, but much
is left.” He raised his hand in blessing and the
two parted. Captain Du Bois watched the
good man in his shabby <i>soutane</i> as he went on
up the street, and felt warmed by the fine fire
of faith and hope which illumined the face of this
good friend who had lost so much and who
yet maintained his simple belief in the higher
orderings of Heaven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>“Much has been taken, but much is left,”
pondered Marcel Du Bois as he entered his
little home. His wife, his daughter, these two
best blessings were left. He went in smiling
and put an arm around each. “Much has been
taken, but much is left,” he quoted. “Another
Christmas, perhaps, shall see the factory chimneys
smoking, shall see our old home restored,
life again something as it was before the war.”</p>

<p>“And what shall we do with this little house?”
asked Lucie, leaning back against his shoulder
and looking up at him.</p>

<p>“This little house? We’ll have to let Paulette,
Jean and Odette live in it, unless you are
counting upon it to use as a doll house.”</p>

<p>“A doll house,” cried Lucie contemptuously.
“Why, papa, I am grown up.”</p>

<p>“Really?” He smiled. “I haven’t discovered
it. We have those four years, your
mother and I, four years of your childhood to
make up. We have been cheated out of them,
and we cannot consider you grown up till we
have been paid back those lost years.”</p>

<p>“Oh, papa!” Lucie looked quite taken aback.</p>

<p>“Four years,” he repeated, laughing and
pinching her cheek.</p>

<p>A week later appeared Victor. The meeting
between the older and the younger soldier was
good to see. For the time being Lucie felt
herself a person of small consequence. Victor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>
was absorbed in her father, he in Victor. After
the first half hour Lucie slipped away. She
was not grown up; no one considered her so.
Even her old playmate treated her like the
child she felt herself to be. She threw something
around her and went out into the garden,
now winter-locked. She looked back to see if
Pom Pom were following, but he was all too
content to be within reach of Victor’s hand,
within sound of his voice. She sighed as she
looked at the broken wall separating her own
garden from that which was now a wilderness.
Those good old days! No more Annette; no
more those lightsome hours of play.</p>

<p>The kitchen door was open. She heard
Paulette and Odette talking inside. “He will
marry Mlle. Annette, Madame Gaspard, I
should say,” she heard Paulette’s voice.</p>

<p>“I do not believe it,” answered Odette.</p>

<p>“And why not?” Paulette asked. “Of
course one must give them time, but it is plain
to every one that it would be the best arrangement.”</p>

<p>“I do not think those two will ever marry,”
Odette maintained.</p>

<p>“One gives you credit for much good sense,
my daughter,” laughed Paulette, “but you are
too young to know everything. I say the thing
will be accomplished and I am not the only one
who thinks so.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>Lucie gave a little impatient kick at a bit of
stone in her path, and waited to hear no more,
but went on to visit the rabbits. She felt very
lonely. She had few girl acquaintances in the
town and those she had known were now far
away, safely sheltered in some convent school.
Why was every one so bent upon talking about
Annette and Victor? and why had Victor just
now greeted her in that slightly embarrassed,
slightly distant manner? Heretofore he had
always been so cordial, so unconsciously natural.
What was it that made the difference? It must
be as Paulette surmised.</p>

<p>She entered the little shed and sat down to
take a baby bunny in her lap, stroking the small
creature’s long, soft ears. “And there is Pom
Pom,” she soliloquized, “even he will not miss
me so much once he is again in Victor’s hands.
Odette thinks of no one but Jean, and Annette
has her baby. I have my beloved parents,
ungrateful that I am, but it is hard to feel
one’s self slipping into second place, third place,
no place in the affections of one’s friends.” She
sat there for some time nursing the little baby
rabbit. She saw her father and Victor go out
the gate, Pom Pom at their heels. The two
men were talking earnestly as they moved off
down the street. After a time Lucie put the
rabbit back with his brothers and sisters, then
she went into the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>Her mother looked up brightly as she
came in. “Where have you been, dear
daughter?”</p>

<p>Lucie smiled somewhat wofully. “Out in
the shed with the rabbits.”</p>

<p>“You couldn’t have found them very lively
companions.”</p>

<p>“No, but they were better than none. I
meant to go down to see Miss Lowndes, but I
saw papa and Victor walking off in that direction
and thought I’d better wait till the coast
was clear.”</p>

<p>“For the possible meeting of that ideal American
soldier you were talking of the other
day?”</p>

<p>“Maybe. Miss Lowndes is going very soon.
Every one is deserting me.”</p>

<p>“Why, my dear.” Her mother looked up,
surprising tears in her daughter’s eyes. “Why
are you so melancholy, dear little girl?”</p>

<p>“Miss Lowndes is going, and Uncle Philip
cannot stay very long on this side the world.”</p>

<p>“But from the looks of things we shall see
them both again, and together, in all probability.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but that doesn’t help the present
parting.”</p>

<p>“But think what pleasure we shall have in
looking forward to seeing them again. Some
day we shall be going over to my old home and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>
there you will find Miss Lowndes transformed
into a new aunt. That should make you very
happy, as it does me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I shall like that.” Lucie brightened a
little, though she said rather mournfully, “I’m
afraid I shall appear very ignorant to those
relatives over there. Miss Lowndes knows
such a lot about everything.”</p>

<p>“Well, dear, we know your education has
been neglected of late, but we shall find a good
school for you. Those four years your father
spoke of, they will have to be made up, though
we shall not be satisfied to send you too far
from us after this long separation.”</p>

<p>“But why at all? Cannot we find a teacher
here?”</p>

<p>“We shall see; we shall see. The main
thing is to make up for lost time. There are
many girls like you who will be wanting to
begin their studies where they left off four years
ago, and the opportunities will come. It is
wonderful what has been done already for the
children orphaned or stranded.”</p>

<p>Lucie did not reply to this, but presently she
said: “I suppose the time is coming when I
must give back Pom Pom, that hurts dreadfully,
and there is Odette going to marry.”</p>

<p>“But you are delighted at that. You
wouldn’t alter that fact, I am sure.”</p>

<p>“No, no. And Annette—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>“But Annette is no new grievance; that has
become quite an old story, hasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Ye-es, but there Victor comes in. We have
been such comrades. I have been going over
it all out there in the shed. I can’t forget that
day when he met me on the road after that
night in the cow shed, and we dug out Long
Ears. He was so wonderful.”</p>

<p>“Long Ears was?”</p>

<p>“No, no, it is Victor I am talking about.
Then that day of the shoes when he was so
clever about getting my footprint. That was
a heavenly day to remember. Then when he
made the secret about going to <i>Coin-du-Pres</i>;
he was so happy over it. And now I must
think of those things no more, for if he marries
Annette they will be absorbed in one another
and I shall no longer be first with any friend.
It is very hard to be superseded.”</p>

<p>Her mother drew her down upon her lap and
kissed her. “I suppose it is the end of the year
which brings these melancholy thoughts; it
can be nothing else, of course. Cheer up, dear
child, who knows what unknown knight may
not be riding along to meet you in the new year,
that ideal knight of yours.”</p>

<p>Lucie drew a long sigh, but said nothing.</p>

<p>“Here come your father and Victor,” her
mother glanced out the window; “let us hear
what good news they have to tell.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>“Where have they been?”</p>

<p>“Looking over the factory. Does it seem
promising?” she asked as the two men came
in.</p>

<p>“Very promising,” replied her husband, nodding
with a satisfied air. “There seems to be
but one thing left to settle.” He glanced at
Lucie, who still sat, with downcast eyes, upon
her mother’s knee.</p>

<p>Madame Du Bois smiled and lifted her eyebrows
suggestively as she turned to Victor.
“And what about <i>Coin-du-Pres</i>?” she asked.</p>

<p>“That depends,” answered the young man
hesitatingly, and also glancing at Lucie. “The
other alternative, naturally, is much more to be
desired.”</p>

<p>Lucie glanced up quickly. What did he
mean?</p>

<p>A rather embarrassed silence fell upon the
group. It was broken by Captain Du Bois,
who went over and stood in front of Lucie and
her mother.</p>

<p>“Dear daughter,” he said, “you know very
well that your mother and I fell in love in the
old-fashioned way, and we have always said
that we meant our child should have the same
freedom of choice when the time came. There
happens, however, to arise an occasion when we
must ask you to help us in a decision. I am
hoping to reëstablish my business, and Heaven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span>
seems to have sent to me one who of all men I
should choose to associate with me as junior
partner. Our good friend Victor Guerin prefers
commercial life here rather than life on a farm
at <i>Coin-du-Pres</i>, but there are conditions which
only you can carry out. Victor will consent
to be my partner only if he can also be my son-in-law.
He has loved you very loyally, served
you very faithfully, dear daughter.”</p>

<p>Lucie’s head drooped very low. Her cheeks
were crimson, but she appeared unable to make
any reply.</p>

<p>“Of course this is all in the future,” her father
went on, “for your school days are not over and
it will take a long time to get the business
running again, but it must be you who shall
decide whether Victor stay or go, and the
decision must be guided not by any interest for
me, but entirely by what your own heart says.
If you decide against him, Victor will return
to <i>Coin-du-Pres</i> to carry out the plans which
seem best there.”</p>

<p>Lucie looked across her father at Victor, who
was leaning forward watching her with all his
heart in his eyes. “You mean—?”</p>

<p>“That I shall do what seems to be the desire
of my family, should this project fail. I am
not a farmer, but I shall try to become one. I
am not in love with Annette, nor she with me,
but—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>Lucie sprang to her feet and ran to him, holding
out both hands. “Oh, Victor,” she cried,
“please don’t go back to <i>Coin-du-Pres</i>. If you
marry Annette I shall be perfectly miserable.”</p>

<p>She ran back to her mother to hide her burning
face. “I don’t want the American knight to
ride out of the new year. It is Victor, Victor
I want,” she whispered.</p>

<p>“I have known that for a long time,” her
mother whispered back, half laughing. Victor
came over, found one of Lucie’s hands and
kissed it softly, then he rose to face Captain Du
Bois.</p>

<p>“God bless you, my son,” said Lucie’s father.
“<i>Vive la France!</i>”</p>

<p>So Odette was right again, and if ever a year,
begun evilly, went out happily so did 1918 that
night. What the new year might bring who
could tell, but that it promised hope, happiness
and peace was not to be questioned.</p>
